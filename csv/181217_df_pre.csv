i hope thi is the right place for thi question tl dr i want to add chapter marker to a file while i am record it solut need to work in a window environ and i need to be abl to creat the chapter marker via command line i don't care what the file format is i have search for thi extens on googl but haven't found ani solut so either what i want is imposs or i'm use search for the wrong thing as it seem unlik that i'm the first person to want to do thi long version with detail i'm creat audio record of survey that will be use for research and qualiti control we current use sox to record becaus of the command line capabl mean we can use our survey administr softwar to automat turn on record when particip give consent i'd realli like to find a way to add chapter marker or similar embed data about where specif survey question start within the file thi would hope allow research and qualiti control staff to quickli find a singl question in a larg audio file for thi to be practic i need to be abl to pass thi inform via command line while the record is be creat i don't think sox can do thi but perhap someon here ha idea on whether thi can be accomplish with other tool i'm not wed to ani specif file format we current use mp3 but if there is a solut avail for thi i'm alreadi assum i need to chang to a differ format the survey we conduct rang in length between 45 minut and 3 hour and we conduct thousand of survey per year so edit chapter marker in post is out of scope i have consid break the record into mani singl question file but thi would mean creat hundr of file per survey administ so file manag could be cumbersom addit some question are veri short onli a few second and we have had issu with sox cut off the final coupl second of some file it seem when we creat a new file it discard whatev is in the buffer at that time instead of write it to the file so far thi ha been an accept level of data loss as we current onli split each survey into a few track due to our experi with sox becom unstabl with mp3 track over 90 minut in length howev it would not be accept to lose the final second of everi question we administ becaus that would often mean lose the answer given by the survey particip thank for read and consid thi problem,ani way to add chapter marker to file dure record,i hope this is the right place for this question tl dr i want to add chapter marker to a file while i am recording it solution need to work in a window environment and i need to be able to create the chapter marker via command line i don't care what the file format is i have searched for this extensively on google but haven't found any solution so either what i want is impossible or i'm using searching for the wrong thing a it seems unlikely that i'm the first person to want to do this long version with detail i'm creating audio recording of survey that will be used for research and quality control we currently use sox to record because of the command line capability meaning we can use our survey administration software to automatically turn on recording when participant give consent i'd really like to find a way to add chapter marker or similar embedded data about where specific survey question start within the file this would hopefully allow researcher and quality control staff to quickly find a single question in a large audio file for this to be practical i need to be able to pas this information via command line while the recording is being created i don't think sox can do this but perhaps someone here ha idea on whether this can be accomplished with other tool i'm not wed to any specific file format we currently use mp3 but if there is a solution available for this i'm already assuming i need to change to a different format the survey we conduct range in length between 45 minute and 3 hour and we conduct thousand of survey per year so editing chapter marker in post is out of scope i have considered breaking the recording into many single question file but this would mean creating hundred of file per survey administered so file management could be cumbersome additionally some question are very short only a few second and we have had issue with sox cutting off the final couple second of some file it seems when we create a new file it discard whatever is in the buffer at that time instead of writing it to the file so far this ha been an acceptable level of data loss a we currently only split each survey into a few track due to our experience with sox becoming unstable with mp3 track over 90 minute in length however it would not be acceptable to lose the final second of every question we administer because that would often mean losing the answer given by the survey participant thanks for reading and considering this problem,any way to add chapter marker to file during recording,0

so just like the titl say is it ok for plugin to peak as long as everyth is turn down at the end of the chain i ll give an exampl say i have a compressor i m push it pretti hard and the meter in the plugin is hit red but it s not clip i ll usual pull it down to keep it out of the red befor continu process the signal is thi necessari sometim it s not peak on the plugin s meter but i ll have an eq set up after my compress and the in signal on the eq is peak should i turn down the compressor or can just turn down my in signal on the eq sometim it s fine in the plugin but the track meter is peak but i can t hear ani clip should i turn down down the track or tweak my plugin so they don t push the signal too hard often even though there s no peak in the plugin i ll have to turn down the plugin so my signal is not peak the in of a plugin after it doe thi matter or should i be more concern with actual clip assum there s no audibl clip at what stage should i be concern about be in the red can i just slap a limit after my my crank compressor or at the end of my effect chain or do i have to be super meticul and make sure the signal isn t peak at each stage of process even though there s no clip,peak within plugin or in between plugin but no clip is thi ok,so just like the title say is it ok for plugins to peak a long a everything is turned down at the end of the chain i ll give an example say i have a compressor i m pushing it pretty hard and the meter in the plugin is hitting red but it s not clipping i ll usually pull it down to keep it out of the red before continue processing the signal is this necessary sometimes it s not peaking on the plugin s meter but i ll have an eq set up after my compression and the in signal on the eq is peaking should i turn down the compressor or can just turn down my in signal on the eq sometimes it s fine in the plugin but the track meter is peaking but i can t hear any clipping should i turn down down the track or tweak my plugins so they don t push the signal too hard often even though there s no peak in the plugin i ll have to turn down the plugin so my signal is not peaking the in of a plugin after it doe this matter or should i be more concerned with actual clipping assuming there s no audible clipping at what stage should i be concerned about being in the red can i just slap a limiter after my my cranked compressor or at the end of my effect chain or do i have to be super meticulous and make sure the signal isn t peaking at each stage of processing even though there s no clipping,peaking within plugins or in between plugins but no clipping is this ok,0

hey guy i am work on some track that have most of their harmon content come from guitar 2 differ chord invers and rhythm of extend chord and one bass guitar thi is more of a gener question but i am wonder how you fill out an arrang for a song that is mostli guitar to my ear there' a certain narrow to the electr guitar play chord that someth like an electr piano rhode sound doesn't have narrow in width but also frequenc content a thin that a few interlock synth chord doesn't have when combin in a full arrang with key and mayb string or pad and other instrument guitar do a nice job of accentu certain part of the harmoni through chord stab and fill but when it is just guitar it seem to not fill the wide frequenc rang that a piano or key would and it also doesn't have an attack that natur lend itself to 'hold down' an arrang as well either and thi is come from someon who ha play guitar for 15 year i know my instrument and i know it' short come i am also wonder how you manag arrang situat as far as what effect and 'differences' you put on the guitar to make them fill out an arrang or what play style in comparison to the other you encourag so how do you deal with a creat a song that ha that full but is harmon carri onli by electr guitar thank edit im go for a sort of r b/soul/smooth jazz sound a lot of guitar recommend for product come for thing that in my head make sens in a two distort guitar pan hard type scenario sort of a rock/met world if you will and that' cool i'v done that to success befor but i'd rather have someon think in the line of these genr i'm mention which in my mind reli heavili on the e piano sound to carri the harmoni and think again how thi can be achiev with just guitar thank,arrang a track that is mostli guitar tone effect etc,hey guy i am working on some track that have most of their harmonic content coming from guitar 2 different chord inversion and rhythm of extended chord and one bass guitar this is more of a general question but i am wondering how you fill out an arrangement for a song that is mostly guitar to my ear there's a certain narrowness to the electric guitar playing chord that something like an electric piano rhodes sound doesn't have narrow in width but also frequency content a thinness that a few interlocking synth chord doesn't have when combined in a full arrangement with key and maybe string or pad and other instrument guitar do a nice job of accentuating certain part of the harmony through chord stab and fill but when it is just guitar it seems to not fill the wide frequency range that a piano or key would and it also doesn't have an attack that naturally lends itself to 'holding down' an arrangement a well either and this is coming from someone who ha played guitar for 15 year i know my instrument and i know it's short coming i am also wondering how you manage arrangement situation a far a what effect and 'differences' you put on the guitar to make them fill out an arrangement or what playing style in comparison to the other you encourage so how do you deal with a creating a song that ha that fullness but is harmonically carried only by electric guitar thanks edit im going for a sort of r b/soul/smooth jazz sound a lot of guitar recommendation for production come for thing that in my head make sense in a two distorted guitar panned hard type scenario sort of a rock/metal world if you will and that's cool i've done that to success before but i'd rather have someone think in the line of these genre i'm mentioning which in my mind rely heavily on the e piano sound to carry the harmony and think again how this can be achieved with just guitar thanks,arranging a track that is mostly guitar tone effect etc,0

sorri for the long post but i have a lot to ask i m look for guidelin tip etc while i start down the road of improv my band s rehears sound we are a group of middl age friend who recent start get togeth weekli to rehears rock song mostli grung most of us play in band in the past but stop due to kids/work we re all back into it and are look to improv as musician who might occasion play out but for now it s just for fun we share a 15 x 20 rehears space with other band which look like thi http //imgur com/a/7krpono i have amateur experi with home record and have done live sound a few time but i m veri green i think i have ok ear and am a bit of an audiophil and i usual pay attent to a mix even when casual listen to music setup 1 mixer allen heath qu 16 2 two wedg floor monitor forget the brand but they re 15 with horn and sound ok 3 monitor are use for vocal guitar one direct from model other mic ed from small amp and key direct stereo 4 bass play straight through larg bass amp 5 drum are not mic ed what work 1 the space is comfort with carpet and acoust treatment on the wall ceil are high 10 or so 2 drum riser is good give us nice face to face visibl 3 awesom mixer decent monitor 4 we religi record and review each rehears to hear what s go on i ll post some sampl after we get some obviou thing dial in not worth listen to right now 5 bandmat are cool we re all in thi for fun we re all old and so no ego stuff happen i mention thi becaus they ll be more open to experi vs have a hotshot guitar player who need to be max volum all the time what doesn t work 1 wish we could get rid of some of the furnitur and spread out more but it s not our space 2 we usual play way too loudli and it s one of those thing where we start out loud and get super loud by the end i took a measur one day with a proper meter and we were close to 110db room volum and that wasn t our loudest 3 i play guitar and usual can t hear myself even though i m right in front of the monitor thi is appar in our record too in fact over the two month that we ve been togeth we ll cycl between bass too loud drum too loud key too loud etc setup question 1 should we mic the kick drum and if so is a fanci drum mic necessari or can we use an old sm57/58 for now 2 should we run the bass direct and if so do we need a di box or can we plug straight into the board reason for not do thi is fatigu the monitor and also the bass amp sound cool and veri full through the amp 3 floor wedg are angl toward the center given our small space should we aim these straight back so those of us who stand off axi can hear more 4 ani tip for reduc room volum and what is an ideal room volum anyway tough convers to have as everyon want to use the time to rock out and let off steam but when we play so loudli it s imposs to hear each other and everyth is a mush of sound plu not at all good for our ear we wear plug but still mix build 1 what are the standard do thi everi time or never do thi thing e g don't turn yourself up without check with other becaus mayb the rest can turn down 2 from other repli it sound like i should start with the drum then bring bass to similar volum then guitar then key final vocal 3 is it correct that when set level that everyon play at max patch volum and then onli dial back for quiet part of a song right now i think the bass player back off hi volum knob ye i know it s realli a gain knob for sound check and then up it later on for boost which is probabl never dial back i suspect key are do the same i set all my level clean dirti the same and then sound check with my normal dirti patch i have a special boost patch a few db higher just for lead other guitar player ha clean patch quieter than dirti one what kind of ground rule should we have here 4 right now i stupidli have everyon play/s an e chord and tri to quickli dial in level in 20 second i know thi is wrong but what s better should we alway start with the same song and have me adjust as we go through it or start layer on top of the e chord one by one 5 i current pan my guitar a littl more toward me and the other guitar more toward him just so we hear a littl more of ourselv is thi normal/ok to do 6 given our setup is it safe to assum that everyon should be abl to hear everyon somewhat clearli if we get room volum and mix set correctli or will it alway be the case where the drummer can t hear the key for exampl 7 how much should i be tweak while we rehears i want to focu on the song way more than the mix so don t want to be distracted/distract by constantli fiddl but i think it need to be more than the total of 60 second that i m give it now 8 i m assum that if we work on get our rehears mix dial in better then it becom much easier for us to transit to a gig setup if we choos to play out is thi fair thank i know thi is a lot but ani help is appreci i ll post more specif and succinctli as i start work through thi,question long post ask for help with band rehears setup,sorry for the long post

worth listening to right now 5 bandmates are cool we re all in this for fun we re all old and so no ego stuff happening i mention this because they ll be more open to experimenting v having a hotshot guitar player who need to be max volume all the time what doesn t work 1 wish we could get rid of some of the furniture and spread out more but it s not our space 2 we usually play way too loudly and it s one of those thing where we start out loud and get super loud by the end i took a measurement one day with a proper meter and we were close to 110db room volume and that wasn t our loudest 3 i play guitar and usually can t hear myself even though i m right in front of the monitor this is apparent in our recording too in fact over the two month that we ve been together we ll cycle between bass too loud drum too loud key too loud etc setup question 1 should we mic the kick drum and if so is a fancy drum mic necessary or can we use an old sm57/58 for now 2 should we run the bass direct and if so do we need a di box or can we plug straight into the board reason for not doing this is fatiguing the monitor and also the bass amp sound cool and very full through the amp 3 floor wedge are angled toward the center given our small space should we aim these straight back so those of u who stand off axis can hear more 4 any tip for reducing room volume and what is an ideal room volume anyway tough conversation to have a everyone want to use the time to rock out and let off steam but when we play so loudly it s impossible to hear each other and everything is a mush of sound plus not at all good for our ear we wear plug but still mix building 1 what are the standard do this every time or never do this thing e g don't turn yourself up without checking with others because maybe the rest can turn down 2 from other reply it sound like i should start with the drum then bring bass to similar volume then guitar then key finally vocal 3 is it correct that when setting level that everyone play at max patch volume and then only dial back for quiet part of a song right now i think the bass player back off his volume knob yes i know it s really a gain knob for sound check and then ups it later on for boost which is probably never dialed back i suspect key are doing the same i set all my level clean dirty the same and then sound check with my normal dirty patch i have a special boost patch a few db higher just for lead other guitar player ha clean patch quieter than dirty one what kind of ground rule should we have here 4 right now i stupidly have everyone play/sing an e chord and try to quickly dial in level in 20 second i know this is wrong but what s better should we always start with the same song and have me adjust a we go through it or start layering on top of the e chord one by one 5 i currently pan my guitar a little more toward me and the other guitar more toward him just so we hear a little more of ourselves is this normal/ok to do 6 given our setup is it safe to assume that everyone should be able to hear everyone somewhat clearly if we get room volume and mix set correctly or will it always be the case where the drummer can t hear the key for example 7 how much should i be tweaking while we rehearse i want to focus on the song way more than the mix so don t want to be distracted/distracting by constantly fiddling but i think it need to be more than the total of 60 second that i m giving it now 8 i m assuming that if we work on getting our rehearsal mix dialed in better then it becomes much easier for u to transition to a gig setup if we choose to play out is this fair thanks i know this is a lot but any help is appreciated i ll post more specifically and succinctly a i start working through this,question long post asking for help with band rehearsal setup,0

post thi over at the reaper blog forum on fb but just want to post it again here to get everyone' advic so i'v been tri to set up my room properli acoust wise and i'v move my desk like 3 time over the past week tri to work out the best solut for my spot i found a good spot but my room is an odd shape so it' obvious not perfect is it ever though so i did thi thing where you set up a microphon at your listen point where my head is in the equilater triangl and record pink nois to get a readout of where your room is at sonic i analyz the record of the pink nois use voxengo' span the mic wa a sterl st55 obvious i know the mic should be 100 omni but i'm just work with what i have to tri and improv my situat somewhat i then use three instanc of an eq to realli match my room' record of the pink nois to the regular pink nois gener by a pink nois plugin i also set the automat gain compens on the eq' to make sure there wa no increas in volum level from the eq' i tripl check thi use a test tone and there is no volum chang with and without the eq' the result seem to be awesom i save these three eq' as an fx chain call 'room compensation' and it realli seem to help thing sound a littl bit better now i also listen to some refer song i have and they sound great so i'm think that thi is a good thing howev i googl thi and found an articl say that thi wa not a good thing to do i don't understand whi though the eq is compens for the inadequaci in the room right the gener consensu from i'v read on other forum post and articl is that do thi can help solv frequenc issu within a room but not problem that are 'time based' like stand wave i'v seen so mani respons on similar thread like yea don't do that and that' dumb hahah without give much reason but it seem to make sens to me obvious thi isn't a perfect solut and i am current figur out an acoust treatment solut but to me it seem like okay the room is caus for exampl a dip/ris at thi frequenc so let boost/cut it there to make it sound as it actual should make sens right ha anyon ever done thi am i an idiot ani thought would be greatli appreci it' also import to note that thi is onli for monitor purpos if i did a mix i would then bounc the track down without the room compens fx chain,eqe my monitor to solv room problem,posted this over at the reaper blog forum on fb but just wanted to post it again here to get everyone's advice so i've been trying to set up my room properly acoustic wise and i've moved my desk like 3 time over the past week trying to work out the best solution for my spot i found a good spot but my room is an odd shape so it's obviously not perfect is it ever though so i did this thing where you set up a microphone at your listening point where my head is in the equilateral triangle and recorded pink noise to get a readout of where your room is at sonically i analyzed the recording of the pink noise using voxengo's span the mic wa a sterling st55 obviously i know the mic should be 100 omni but i'm just working with what i have to try and improve my situation somewhat i then used three instance of an eq to really match my room's recording of the pink noise to the regular pink noise generated by a pink noise plugin i also set the automatic gain compensation on the eq's to make sure there wa no increase in volume level from the eq's i triple checked this using a test tone and there is no volume change with and without the eq's the result seems to be awesome i saved these three eq's a an fx chain called 'room compensation' and it really seems to help thing sound a little bit better now i also listened to some reference song i have and they sound great so i'm thinking that this is a good thing however i googled this and found an article saying that this wa not a good thing to do i don't understand why though the eq is compensating for the inadequacy in the room right the general consensus from i've read on other forum post and article is that doing this can help solve frequency issue within a room but not problem that are 'time based' like standing wave i've seen so many response on similar thread like yea don't do that and that's dumb hahah without giving much reason but it seems to make sense to me obviously this isn't a perfect solution and i am currently figuring out an acoustic treatment solution but to me it seems like okay the room is causing for example a dip/rise at this frequency so let boost/cut it there to make it sound a it actually should make sense right ha anyone ever done this am i an idiot any thought would be greatly appreciated it's also important to note that this is only for monitoring purpose if i did a mix i would then bounce the track down without the room compensation fx chain,eqing my monitor to solve room problem,0

i am current ponder on the question 'where to appli the eq match techniqu e g via ozon 8 eq match ff pro q2 mfreeformequ and use the classic refer techniqu to compar it to my own sound while one is at the master stage ' have said thi my aim is to refer the 'full' part of my song to a 'full' part of a refer mix my thought are that if you want to make use of eq match that it should be done after the final limit on the one hand so consid the fact that the compressor s and the limit on my master chain can chang the spectrum do eq match or referenc a mix befor the master compressor and master limit could thu be a comparison between a refer mix and my own mix which would not even be the final sound provid that the compressor and/or limit would affect the spectrum that would be compar appl to orang a comparison after the final limit not on the other hand find out that my mix is too far off from the refer mix after appli one or both of these techniqu after the final limit could possibl make thing rather complic for exampl my eq matcher could say that i lack between 800hz 1k where in the master chain should one fix thi if one desir to follow the eq matcher' 'advice' if there is an eq befor the master compressor and you notch up 800hz 1k it could lead to differ reaction on the master compressor and limit and that would lead to have to set up one or both of those applic again it is sure not the most practic way but perhap still a way which is worth to recommend and to go a littl further into thi subject let' take it into the mix stage how should one appli the eq match techniqu and use the classic refer techniqu to compar for exampl a solo lead to my own solo lead when we talk about process in the lead bu while still have an empti master chain,eq match and referenc at master stage,i am currently pondering on the question 'where to apply the eq matching technique e g via ozone 8 eq matching ff pro q2 mfreeformequalizer and using the classic reference technique to compare it to my own sound while one is at the mastering stage ' having said this my aim is to reference the 'full' part of my song to a 'full' part of a reference mix my thought are that if you want to make use of eq matching that it should be done after the final limiter on the one hand so considering the fact that the compressor s and the limiter on my master chain can change the spectrum doing eq matching or referencing a mix before the master compressor and master limiter could thus be a comparison between a reference mix and my own mix which would not even be the final sound provided that the compressor and/or limiter would affect the spectrum that would be comparing apple to orange a comparison after the final limiter not on the other hand finding out that my mix is too far off from the reference mix after applying one or both of these technique after the final limiter could possibly make thing rather complicated for example my eq matcher could say that i lack between 800hz 1k where in the master chain should one fix this if one desire to follow the eq matcher's 'advice' if there is an eq before the master compressor and you notch up 800hz 1k it could lead to different reaction on the master compressor and limiter and that would lead to having to set up one or both of those application again it is surely not the most practical way but perhaps still a way which is worth to recommend and to go a little further into this subject let's take it into the mixing stage how should one apply the eq matching technique and using the classic reference technique to compare for example a solo lead to my own solo lead when we talking about processing in the lead bus while still having an empty master chain,eq matching and referencing at mastering stage,0

thi question is inspir by a thumpin pedal i'v discov recent http //sfxsound com/microthumpinator/ http //sfxsound com/microthumpinator/ i'v check some other review and mostli they highlight how the low b 31hz sound less muddi the thumpin is just a hpf with a cutoff frequenc around 29hz as i understood when play bass fingerstyl there' addit low frequenc content that get through to the speaker from the finger hit the string and it may muddi up the harmon content in the lowest rang so i'v been think if you play a standard bass wouldn't you get thi benefit from cut off everyth below the low e frequenc there' no harmon content we lose but there' alway a possibl of some nois be down there especi when play live,if a four string bass guitar' low e frequenc is 41hz isn't hpfing bass guitar at 40hz a good idea,this question is inspired by a thumpinator pedal i've discovered recently http //sfxsound com/microthumpinator/ http //sfxsound com/microthumpinator/ i've checked some other review and mostly they highlight how the low b 31hz sound le muddy the thumpinator is just a hpf with a cutoff frequency around 29hz a i understood when playing bass fingerstyle there's additional low frequency content that get through to the speaker from the finger hitting the string and it may muddy up the harmonic content in the lowest range so i've been thinking if you play a standard bass wouldn't you get this benefit from cutting off everything below the low e frequency there's no harmonic content we lose but there's always a possibility of some noise being down there especially when playing live,if a four string bass guitar's low e frequency is 41hz isn't hpfing bass guitar at 40hz a good idea,0

becaus everi time i go through all my sound to remov mudi the entir project end up sound realli weak with no energi in that specif area,when remov muddi frequenc is the aim to remov them entir or attentu them so that they sound 'natural',because every time i go through all my sound to remove mudiness the entire project end up sounding really weak with no energy in that specific area,when removing muddy frequency is the aim to remove them entirely or attentuate them so that they sound 'natural',0

so i wa wonder if anyon know if it' possibl to basic use a guitar pedal as an impuls respons type thing and i guess sampl it and then use it as a filter and separ effect dure product i have a multi effect guitar pedal and i use amp bia fx to record my guitar but i obvious keep the di guitar signal howev when use the pedal that goe straight in through my interfac from the pedal itself so the di guitar signal is now come directli from the pedal mean that it ha an effect over it and is no longer a normal clean di signal i want to be abl to sampl the effect that' on the guitar somehow so that i can record my guitar di but then still be abl to use the effect that i want from my pedal i know that i could just re amp with the effect later but i don't want to do that becaus sometim play with the effect on is what make me play a riff or part of a song a certain way so re amp is someth i want to avoid in thi case i'm not sure if thi is possibl but anyth would be appreci link to ani video or ani explan i'm also not want to have to dive too deep into the world of program and diy pluggin so i would like to avoid all of that kind of stuff like i said i just wanna be abl to sort of sampl the effect itself or the characterist sound of it and be abl to appli it later as an effect like i would a reverb plugin or someth i use reaper as my daw if that help or make ani differ in what my option are thank,guitar effect,so i wa wondering if anyone know if it's possible to basically use a guitar pedal a an impulse response type thing and i guess sample it and then use it a a filter and separate effect during production i have a multi effect guitar pedal and i use amp bias fx to record my guitar but i obviously keep the di guitar signal however when using the pedal that go straight in through my interface from the pedal itself so the di guitar signal is now coming directly from the pedal meaning that it ha an effect over it and is no longer a normal clean di signal i want to be able to sample the effect that's on the guitar somehow so that i can record my guitar di but then still be able to use the effect that i want from my pedal i know that i could just re amp with the effect later but i don't want to do that because sometimes playing with the effect on is what make me play a riff or part of a song a certain way so re amping is something i want to avoid in this case i'm not sure if this is possible but anything would be appreciated link to any video or any explanation i'm also not wanting to have to dive too deep into the world of programming and diy pluggins so i would like to avoid all of that kind of stuff like i said i just wanna be able to sort of sample the effect itself or the characteristic sound of it and be able to apply it later a an effect like i would a reverb plugin or something i use reaper a my daw if that help or make any difference in what my option are thanks,guitar effect,0

hi there i want to share with you a discoveri i found while do parallel process in logic pro 8 which i have a suspicion may still appli to logic 9 and x problem wa that one of the main group buss wa lag by about 50m or so than the rest of my main buss everi channel wa sent to one of 5 main group buss 1 drum 2 instrument pump with a sidechain 3 instrument i want no pump 4 bass and 5 wobbl fx buss all were output to output 1 2 except for wobbl buss and reverb buss which were both rout back to the instrument buss with sidechain and thi rout is exactli what wa caus the problem i wa abl to test thi by send a snare hit to the buss in question while simultan send to one of the other buss also test with main out and you would hear it slap twice i wa fear that perhap new york compress and other parallel process techniqu might encount issu in logic pro with latenc issu due to some architectur 'error' howev with a littl experiment i wa abl to allevi the problem the short short summari is that it seem logic may have issu with multipl aux output to eachoth rather than when they all output directli to output 1 2 aux1 instrument were sent to thi buss for process with an lfo to perform a 'wobble' filter effect serum fx gt onli send wa to aux2 for reverb and output to aux3 main instrument pump buss serum fx had a side chain input activ aux2 wave rverb gt output to aux3 main instrument pump buss aux3 main instrument buss with ssl buss compressor sidechain to a kick drum captur from aux 20 aux 3 wa lag by the 50 or so ms compar to the other aux/buss group latenc wa set to all in logic pro set so in theori compens should have been all in align but check thi out when i remov aux1' reverb send the latenc disappear likewis when i chang the output from the reverb buss aux2 from aux 3 to output 1 2 the latenc would also go away i should note when i would remov all plugin from the reverb aux thi had no effect on latenc if still output to aux 3 so we might conclud that there wa someth about two separ aux channel wobbl buss and reverb buss feed into a common 3rd aux creat delay compens issu with that particular aux channel but there more to the stori if i remov the sidechain from serum fx on aux1 the latenc disappear it didn't matter what wa go on with the reverb aux so i thought mayb thi wa all due to a flaw with serum i remov serum ad an ssl compressor to the same aux channel aux1 latenc still gone but then i ad a sidechain to the compressor and guess what latenc back and i could perform the same experi abov with the reverb channel so there wa someth about have a sidechain aux and it send ultim meet at a final common aux that will caus it to experi faulti delay compens remov either the sidechain or chang the send rout and the problem goe away weird right anyon want to chime in on what might be happen here interestingli i have not been abl to recreat thi experi all the time it seem to happen at random if i were to take a stab at what' go on here i think it ha someth to do with how the busses/aux are rout intern with logic when they are establish initi and how it relat to the delay compens algorithm perhap it depend on the order of when they are establish rout to eachoth or when the plugin are ad the list could go on and on so i would suggest be awar that these problem may happen in logic when aux are be sent to other aux and there is some sidechan go on not a common issu or scenario i'm sure but still someth to bear in mind hope thi wasn't too convolut but i invit you to repeat the experi and see if you can come up with anyth,logic pro parallel process latenc issu resolv sort of,hi there i wanted to share with you a discovery i found while doing parallel processing in logic pro 8 which i have a suspicion may still apply to logic 9 and x problem wa that one of the main group bus wa lagged by about 50ms or so than the rest of my main bus every channel wa sent to one of 5 main group bus 1 drum 2 instrument pumped with a sidechain 3 instrument i wanted no pump 4 bass and 5 wobble fx bus all were outputting to output 1 2 except for wobble bus and reverb bus which were both routed back to the instrument bus with sidechain and this routing is exactly what wa causing the problem i wa able to test this by sending a snare hit to the bus in question while simultaneously sending to one of the other bus also tested with main out and you would hear it slap twice i wa fearing that perhaps new york compression and other parallel processing technique might encounter issue in logic pro with latency issue due to some architectural 'error' however with a little experimentation i wa able to alleviate the problem the short short summary is that it seems logic may have issue with multiple auxes outputting to eachother rather than when they all output directly to output 1 2 aux1 instrument were sent to this bus for processing with an lfo to perform a 'wobble' filter effect serum fx gt only send wa to aux2 for reverb and outputted to aux3 main instrumentation pump bus serum fx had a side chain input activated aux2 wave rverb gt outputted to aux3 main instrument pump bus aux3 main instrument bus with ssl bus compressor sidechained to a kick drum captured from aux 20 aux 3 wa lagging by the 50 or so m compared to the other aux/buss group latency wa set to all in logic pro setting so in theory compensation should have been all in alignment but check this out when i removed aux1's reverb send the latency disappeared likewise when i changed the output from the reverb bus aux2 from aux 3 to output 1 2 the latency would also go away i should note when i would remove all plugins from the reverb aux this had no effect on latency if still outputting to aux 3 so we might conclude that there wa something about two separate aux channel wobble bus and reverb bus feeding into a common 3rd aux creating delay compensation issue with that particular aux channel but there more to the story if i removed the sidechain from serum fx on aux1 the latency disappeared it didn't matter what wa going on with the reverb aux so i thought maybe this wa all due to a flaw with serum i removed serum added an ssl compressor to the same aux channel aux1 latency still gone but then i added a sidechain to the compressor and guess what latency back and i could perform the same experiment above with the reverb channel so there wa something about having a sidechained aux and it send ultimately meeting at a final common aux that will cause it to experience faulty delay compensation remove either the sidechain or change the send routing and the problem go away weird right anyone want to chime in on what might be happening here interestingly i have not been able to recreate this experiment all the time it seems to happen at random if i were to take a stab at what's going on here i think it ha something to do with how the busses/auxes are routed internally with logic when they are established initially and how it relates to the delay compensation algorithm perhaps it depends on the order of when they are established routed to eachother or when the plugins are added the list could go on and on so i would suggest being aware that these problem may happen in logic when auxes are being sent to other auxes and there is some sidechaning going on not a common issue or scenario i'm sure but still something to bear in mind hopefully this wasn't too convoluted but i invite you to repeat the experiment and see if you can come up with anything,logic pro parallel processing latency issue resolved sort of,0

hey guy late i'v been realli tri to learn to get my mix wider and in particular my electr guitar track i recent start play with a trick i learn onlin to just put a stereo delay on a mono guitar track either a signal design stereo delay plugin or ya know make a mono copi hard pan both and then delay one with a sampl delay thi sound good i mean in a mix it sound cool and i could go full blown width at like 180 degre with plenti of room in the middl or i can throw a direct mixer on and reign it in a bit toward like 70 max width on these delay signal either way it wa cool and then i start feed that into a nice stereo hall reverb it sound nice but then just to check the mix i put a direct mixer on the stereo output and made it all mono the volum of thi orign mono guitar track drop drastic wherea other mono element in the mix did not which proport made them seem way louder and sort of ruin the whole balanc i understand thi ha to do with phase cancel right so i am deal with thi becaus it wa origin a mono sourc sound so i have to heavili modifi the hard pan or almost hard pan edit to get them not to be so similar to each other that i get cancel i realli would just like advic on deal with thi problem that i creat for instanc how would you make those two signal 'differ enough' so i don't lose them sum in mono is it pitch correct up and down a few cent each or longer delay between each rn i have like a 10 ms and a 20 ms delay respect but also sort of go back to my origin issu what do you guy do to give a nice wide aspect to a guitar track thi problem came up becaus i am better at guitar than piano i record a track that i want to have the rhythm chang and harmoni carri by an elect guitar mostli thi is tricki becaus it seem so natur mono to me wherea someth like a synth or electr piano carri the harmoni and play the chord progress natur lend itself to a nice wide stereo imag am i think about thi all right i alway feel like i have a decent understand of stereo signal path until i think too hard about it then my understand seem to disappear and i start question myself is thi cancel out is thi two hard pan mono sourc or a singl stereo sourc from my yamaha dx7 hardwar synth are logic x' stock e piano sound two hard pan mono or is there a middl portion to the 'image' of the sound and if so if i put a m/ processor on there and suck out the side am i left with a combin of the two side with a differ time delay etc etc i just sort of think myself in circl and start to feel dumb second guess myself i'd realli appreci ani insight that get me closer to a confid understand of how to add width to 'chord' or harmon instrument track and the abil to call upon thi skillset when i need it instead of just sort of guess and check with differ combin of delay and multi track thank,disappear width,hey guy lately i've been really trying to learn to get my mix wider and in particular my electric guitar track i recently started playing with a trick i learned online to just put a stereo delay on a mono guitar track either a signal designated stereo delay plugin or ya know making a mono copy hard panning both and then delaying one with a sample delay this sounded good i mean in a mix it sounded cool and i could go full blown width at like 180 degree with plenty of room in the middle or i can throw a directional mixer on and reign it in a bit towards like 70 max width on these delayed signal either way it wa cool and then i started feeding that into a nice stereo hall reverb it sounded nice but then just to check the mix i put a directional mixer on the stereo output and made it all mono the volume of this orignally mono guitar track dropped drastically whereas other mono element in the mix did not which proportionally made them seem way louder and sort of ruined the whole balance i understand this ha to do with phase cancellation right so i am dealing with this because it wa originally a mono source sound so i have to heavily modify the hard panned or almost hard panned edits to get them not to be so similar to each other that i get cancellation i really would just like advice on dealing with this problem that i created for instance how would you make those two signal 'different enough' so i don't lose them summed in mono is it pitch correction up and down a few cent each or longer delay between each rn i have like a 10 m and a 20 m delay respectively but also sort of going back to my original issue what do you guy do to give a nice wide aspect to a guitar track this problem came up because i am better at guitar than piano i recorded a track that i wanted to have the rhythm change and harmony carried by an electic guitar mostly this is tricky because it seems so naturally mono to me whereas something like a synth or electric piano carrying the harmony and playing the chord progression naturally lends itself to a nice wide stereo image am i thinking about this all right i always feel like i have a decent understanding of stereo signal path until i think too hard about it then my understanding seems to disappear and i start questioning myself is this cancelling out is this two hard panned mono source or a single stereo source from my yamaha dx7 hardware synth are logic x's stock e piano sound two hard panned mono or is there a middle portion to the 'image' of the sound and if so if i put a m/s processor on there and suck out the side am i left with a combination of the two side with a different time delay etc etc i just sort of think myself in circle and start to feel dumb second guess myself i'd really appreciate any insight that get me closer to a confident understanding of how to add width to 'chord' or harmonic instrument track and the ability to call upon this skillset when i need it instead of just sort of guessing and checking with different combination of delay and multi tracking thanks,disappearing width,0

speaker can be virtual simul with headphon veri convincingli with impuls respons and convolut softwar thi howev requir the impuls respons to be measur for the individu listen and headphon i'm tri to achiev thi i made impuls respons record by play sine sweep on left and right speaker separ and measur it with two ear canal block microphon i turn these sweep record into impuls respons with voxengo deconvolv softwar i also measur my headphon the same way and compens their frequenc respons with an eq by invert the frequenc respons as heard by the same microphon impuls respons are quit good and certainli better than ani other out of the box impuls respons i have ever heard howev they are suffer a littl by coars sound signatur is a bit bright and sound local is a tad fuzzi when listen on headphon a music record which wa record with the mic in ear while play the music on speaker the result is practic indistinguish from actual listen to speaker my impuls respons and convolut come close but still leav me want for better i think the main problem might be the nois introduc by my motherboard mic input i thought about use digit voic record like zoom h1n for the job thi model can do overdub record with zero delay between the playback and record make it possibl even to record each speaker separ i'm also assum that the mic input on thi thing is quit a bit better than my pc motherboard doe is seem like sensibl idea to use voic record and are there better option can you think of other sourc of error than the nois from the mic input should i do some digit nois filter on the sine sweep record befor run the deconvolut ani other idea for improv the impuls respons,record impuls respons for speaker virtual,speaker can be virtualized simulated with headphone very convincingly with impulse response and convolution software this however requires the impulse response to be measured for the individual listener and headphone i'm trying to achieve this i made impulse response recording by playing sine sweep on left and right speaker separately and measuring it with two ear canal blocking microphone i turned these sweep recording into impulse response with voxengo deconvolver software i also measured my headphone the same way and compensated their frequency response with an eq by inverting the frequency response a heard by the same microphone impulse response are quite good and certainly better than any other out of the box impulse response i have ever heard however they are suffering a little by coarseness sound signature is a bit bright and sound localization is a tad fuzzy when listening on headphone a music recording which wa recorded with the mics in ear while playing the music on speaker the result is practically indistinguishable from actually listening to speaker my impulse response and convolution come close but still leaf me wanting for better i think the main problem might be the noise introduced by my motherboard mic input i thought about using digital voice recorder like zoom h1n for the job this model can do overdub recording with zero delay between the playback and recording making it possible even to record each speaker separately i'm also assuming that the mic input on this thing is quite a bit better than my pc motherboard doe is seem like sensible idea to use voice recorder and are there better option can you think of other source of error than the noise from the mic input should i do some digital noise filtering on the sine sweep recording before running the deconvolution any other idea for improving the impulse response,recording impulse response for speaker virtualization,0

hey all look for some recommend for a pa system for the venu i manag we'r a 1200sq ft extrem oddli shape room http //imgur com/a/njsbfml our venu exclus present jazz mostli modern stuff sinc the room is small enough the acoust level of the drum realli dictat what we throw in the pa which is usual piano and voic and occasion horn that aren't way too loud our room is sort of treat so there isn't stuff bounc around all over the place but definit still a live kind of boomi room our current system is a pair of macki sa1530z the issu i encount is how the sound of the room chang base on where you'r sit in the middl area of the room up to where the mixer is there' a rais roof that goe up about 24 feet the room is at it' regular height at the stage and behind the mixer which is 14 feet as you might guess the chang in roof size affect the sound and thing sound differ on stage vs right in front of the stage vs all the way behind the mixer addit the room also get tinier as in like an l shape so you realli don't get much of the stage right speaker in the back of the room my first thought is that the macki are rais at the 14 feet height of the ceil so hang at about 11 12 feet and are point straight which affect the peopl at the front of the room sit sort of underneath the speaker they don't get as much of it as someon sit in the back as i mention the room is treat but the shape of the room is realli hard to fight so there' onli so much the treatment can do for us so for now i'd like to solv the speaker issu and see if there' ani better option avail for a 1200sq ft room two 1300watt speaker are a bit much i think although i can't seem to find anyth smaller than that that is also 3 way so my first question/assumpt is chang the way my current macki are mount by aim them a bit more down would that help the distribut of sound my second question is are there ani speaker that may be better suit for the job for a second i wa think about do a faux vertic array with 4 speaker 2 on each side one pair point straight ahead and one pair point down more but mayb there' a singl pair of speaker that may do the trick without have to work on an array i should mention my budget for thi is 2000 hope less obvious chang the mount on my current speaker would be the cheapest option probabl not run me ani more than 1000 for the part and labor but speaker i'v been look at have been 1000 each hope to hear some good suggest and thank in advanc,speaker recommend for a jazz venu,hey all looking for some recommendation for a pa system for the venue i manage we're a 1200sq ft

our budget right now would be about 1500 but we will be slowli ad more over the next few year right now we alreadi have a mixer and speaker with an amplifi which belong to member of the group but eventu we will buy those as well the object is to get some kind of practic hold and perform with mic practic blend but we would also like to take it to gig we need 13 14 mic and we would realli like for it to be wireless as that allow us to practic choreographi for competit there a few main possibl that i see 1 get a full set of good wire mic think the sm58 14 x 100 1400 includ cabl but not a snake thi will be most benefici to allow us to hear ourselv and practic on an actual sound system but it doesn t realli let us practic choreo my thought is that if we are primarili concern about icca practic it may be better to do what we ve done in the past and just go practic on someon els s system 2 get a full set of okayish wireless mic perhap the vocopro uhf 5805 4 x 350 which is a set of 4 1400 so these are lower qualiti mic but will still get the job done for right now these would be veri easi to take to gig becaus we wouldn t have to worri about set up a wire system and a snake they will still give us significantli better sound than ani gig we ve liter ever perform at we could definit use these to practic for icca s and do chore as well they just won t give us as profession of a sound 3 get some wireless mic of slightli less qualiti and then two of good qualiti think the vocopro uhf 5800 for the less qualiti and then sennheis 825 for the good one 3 x 300 set of 4 uhf 5800 and then 1 x 500 set of 2 e825 thi set up would allow us to have a fulli wireless system which let us practic icca and choreo and stuff but it also give good sound qualiti for the soloist and mayb a bass of vp thi would give great sound qualiti for gig but again might be compromis a bit more in term of listen to ourselv in rehears would love ani feedback or ani insight on experi with ani of these mic,tri to buy a sound system for an a cappella group what do you think,our budget right now would be about 1500 but we will be slowly adding more over the next few year right now we already have a mixer and speaker with an amplifier which belong to member of the group but eventually we will buy those a well the objective is to get some kind of practice holding and performing with mics practicing blend but we would also like to take it to gig we need 13 14 mics and we would really like for it to be wireless a that allows u to practice choreography for competition there a few main possibility that i see 1 get a full set of good wired mics thinking the sm58 14 x 100 1400 including cable but not a snake this will be most beneficial to allowing u to hear ourselves and practice on an actual sound system but it doesn t really let u practice choreo my thought is that if we are primarily concerned about icca practice it may be better to do what we ve done in the past and just go practice on someone else s system 2 get a full set of okayish wireless mics perhaps the vocopro uhf 5805 4 x 350 which is a set of 4 1400 so these are lower quality mics but will still get the job done for right now these would be very easy to take to gig because we wouldn t have to worry about setting up a wired system and a snake they will still give u significantly better sound than any gig we ve literally ever performed at we could definitely use these to practice for icca s and do chore a well they just won t give u a professional of a sound 3 get some wireless mics of slightly le quality and then two of good quality thinking the vocopro uhf 5800 for the le quality and then sennheiser 825 for the good one 3 x 300 set of 4 uhf 5800 and then 1 x 500 set of 2 e825 this set up would allow u to have a fully wireless system which let u practice icca and choreo and stuff but it also give good sound quality for the soloist and maybe a bass of vp this would give great sound quality for gig but again might be compromising a bit more in term of listening to ourselves in rehearsal would love any feedback or any insight on experience with any of these mics,trying to buy a sound system for an a cappella group what do you think,1

i just got finish up at what i consid the first 'real' live sound gig of my career up till now i'v just been do sound at a small church with onli four band member it' easi to make stori reflect favor on me so i'll tri to be fair first the fact i wa told i would be do sound for a ten piec band in realiti there were eleven instrument and four of them also sang there were also multipl guest soloist that i didn't know about until they came out to do their song in rehears there wa a comed act that came out between song that i didn't know about until the first time he came out on stage dure perform there wa a guest band of over ten banjo player that i didn't know about until ten minut befor the show start the venu did not have all the equip necessari for the show and we had to make an emerg trip to a music store for more cabl i had to set up the entir system myself all musician set up their instrument amp etc but noth beyond that thi wa the first time i had seen thi system and i wa the onli sound technician there i wa also ask to control the light and a powerpoint minut befor the show start thi didn't prove too difficult but it wa anoth respons that i wa not expect that would reflect poorli on me if done incorrectli despit be told to keep wireless mic on all the time and that the talent would turn them off when off stage they end up forget more often than not and i end up babysit the mute button for those channel the entir night now for some more subject thing musician tend to consid everyth my fault even thing i had no control over for instanc due to the lack of equip and hectic setup some backup vocalist had to share a monitor mix with some other instrument when the musician ask for more of x in the monitor the vocalist onli want to hear themselv and i had to tell them it simpli wasn't possibl to have it both way thi put the vocalist in a bad mood for all of rehears dure rehears one musician ran all the way back up the booth to tell me to turn off the mic of one of the vocalist becaus she sound bad i found thi veri irregular in gener i just felt veri out of the loop guest musician were appear left and right at one point dure the perform there wa a mini talent show and i had to scrambl to chang thing around most guest musician end up borrow instrument from regular or plug into their amp with their own instrument i hope thi doesn't come off as too much of a rant sinc thi is my first big show i don't know what' typic and what' not for what it' worth the director said i did a fantast job and want to have me work for him again i'm not sure if i'm cut out for thi though if thi is how it realli is everyth wa so hectic i had to juggl ten thing at onc musician diva eq even the freak light i'm exhaust and i still have a two hour drive home edit thank everyon so much for the advic stori and humor i surviv the whole thing so now part of it can be funni memori instead of stress situat i feel i have a better perspect on the whole thing now and will be better prepar for the next one by the way thi http //imgur com/5b1y5z is the banjo band in the show order keep in mind i receiv thi minut befor the show start,wa thi a bad work environ or am i just too inexperienc,i just got finished up at what i consider the first 'real' live sound gig of my career up till now i've just been doing sound at a small church with only four band member it's easy to make story reflect favorably on me so i'll try to be fair first the fact i wa told i would be doing sound for a ten piece band in reality there were eleven instrument and four of them also

equipment necessary for the show and we had to make an emergency trip to a music store for more cable i had to set up the entire system myself all musician set up their instrument amp etc but nothing beyond that this wa the first time i had seen this system and i wa the only sound technician there i wa also asked to control the light and a powerpoint minute before the show started this didn't prove too difficult but it wa another responsibility that i wa not expecting that would reflect poorly on me if done incorrectly despite being told to keep wireless mics on all the time and that the talent would turn them off when off stage they ended up forgetting more often than not and i ended up babysitting the mute button for those channel the entire night now for some more subjective thing musician tended to consider everything my fault even thing i had no control over for instance due to the lack of equipment and hectic setup some backup vocalist had to share a monitor mix with some other instrument when the musician asked for more of x in the monitor the vocalist only wanted to hear themselves and i had to tell them it simply wasn't possible to have it both way this put the

very irregular in general i just felt very out of the loop guest musician were appearing left and right at one point during the performance there wa a mini talent show and i had to scramble to change thing around most guest musician ended up borrowing instrument from regular or plugging into their amp with their own instrument i hope this doesn't come off a too much of a rant since this is my first big show i don't know what's typical and what's not for what it's worth the director said i did a fantastic job and wanted to have me work for him again i'm not sure if i'm cut out for this though if this is how it really is everything wa so hectic i had to juggle ten thing at once musician diva eq even the freaking light i'm exhausted and i still have a two hour drive home edit thanks everyone so much for the advice story and humor i survived the whole thing so now part of it can be funny memory instead of stressful situation i feel i have a better perspective on the whole thing

howdi y'all prepar some of the new qsc k 2 seri box for a club instal and have some data here from the verif step of the process i thought it wa interest enough to share and there' a coupl of thing i found thought provok as it' my first time work with thi particular product these box come with onboard dsp that allow hpf eq delay and eleven preset tune here' a nifti anim show how each of the preset compar to the raw respons 1/12 oct smooth http //imgur com/v74daw9 http //imgur com/v74daw9 to address the obviou question no it' not a flat line i measur the loudspeak in the real world where it' go to be use not in a lab rather than the line itself what i'm point out here is the differ in each of the preset i person find the gain reduct on some of these preset rather alarm i would have assum that the tune simpli chang the eq curv but a hand of these have pretti sever attenu as well i'd be interest to know what the think wa behind these decis if you'r a system tech you probabl are extrem skeptic of tune preset like these my view on thi is more philosoph than technic if you'r a musician and you just want to plug in and play use whatev preset you think sound the best that' clearli where qsc is go with these preset as an engin howev i feel that eq' the entir system for a specif input is a big no no each eq ha a job and we don't want to get the wire cross i use input eq for input i use loudspeak eq to manag the loudspeak in the space for more on thi approach see thi articl http //www prosoundweb com/channels/church/eq boot camp a regiment approach to effect equalization/ and thi video by dave rat http //www youtub com/watch v cu9bmupc62c now practic if that' all you have at your dispos obvious you want to use it but i tri to adher to strict eq disciplin whenev possibl which keep thing nice and organ and pay off in spade on larger more complex system the bigger and more practic issu is that i don't want to use a preset unless i understand what it' do to my signal thi is the big distinct between the artist and the technic it' perfectli accept in my view for an artist to be ignor of what' happen under the hood as long as they'r get the desir result not so for an engin anoth good exampl of thi is an enhanc plugin or ani sort of magic black box process lot of these exist they all claim to make it sound better but don't elabor on how if you'r a musician and you want to use it for artist reason becaus you like the way it sound go nut but as a system tech i have full respons for the signal chain and everyth in it so if i can't tell you what the devic is do to my signal i'm not go to put it in the signal chain thi isn't about condemn certain product it' about educ myself about what those product do and then make an inform decis as to whether or not it' appropri in the situat in thi specif applic the box in question are destin for use as low profil monitor in a small okay tini club here' how the two stage monitor eq preset affect the respons http //imgur com/fcnb3kk http //imgur com/fcnb3kk yike i'm concern about the gain reduct and i'm not particularli excit about the 1k and 12k peak either but my primarli concern lie with the low end these are small format monitor mostli for vocal on a small loud stage so we certainli don't need all the lf respons when there are larg subwoof a few feet away i want to reduc the lf buildup from the floor coupl but not mangl the respons complet in gener i'll shoot for a highpass rolloff around 100 hz i'm not in love with either of the preset so i figur i'd roll my own time to reset the dsp and start from scratch look at the 100 hz and 125 hz option for the onboard highpass filter http //imgur com/kauvdvd i didn't realli like either of them the 125 hz set purpl trace roll off too high to support the vocal fundament and the 100 hz set light blue is probabl close enough but i'd rather split the differ addit i don't like that bump around 600 hz i wa abl to creat thi respons http //imgur com/xcejqxo use a combin of a lo shelf 2 db 200 hz and a 100 hz hpf along with a parametr cut at 200 hz 2 db q 0 7 now the lf is more of a mesa and less of a hump and i'm still a comfort way down by 80 hz anoth 2 db filter at 800 q 0 5 tame that midrang bump that would have sound unpleas with most vocal mic the instal itself is go to have to happen in a veri small time window becaus the club ha schedul event so my strategi wa to get thing as close to dial in as possibl while still at the shop onc i get into the room next week i should be in the ballpark onli need to adjust for the effect of the specif acoust environ a theme in common with my previou post note that we don't need a ton of eq to get result the filter are wide and gentl noth crazi here in conclus i would say that preset can be handi timesav if they work for you whenev possibl befor use one i'd like to confirm for myself exactli what it' do,between the line 4 preset vs reset,howdy y'all preparing some of the new qsc k 2 series box for a club install and have some data here from the verification step of the process i thought it wa interesting enough to share and there's a couple of thing i found thought provoking a it's my first time working with this particular product these box come with onboard dsp that allows hpf eq delay and eleven preset tuning here's a nifty animation showing how each of the presets compare to the raw response 1/12 oct smoothing http //imgur com/v74daw9 http //imgur com/v74daw9 to address the obvious question no it's not a flat line i measured the loudspeaker in the real world where it's going to be used not in a lab rather than the line itself what i'm pointing out here is the difference in each of the presets i personally find the gain reduction on some of these presets rather alarming i would have assumed that the tuning simply changed the eq curve but a handful of these have pretty severe attenuation a well i'd be interested to know what the thinking wa behind these decision if you're a system tech you probably are extremely skeptical of tuning presets like these my view on this is more philosophical than technical if you're a musician and you just want to plug in and play use whatever preset you think sound the best that's clearly where qsc is going with these presets a an engineer however i feel that eq'ing the entire system for a specific input is a big no no each eq ha a job and we don't want to get the wire crossed i use input eq for input i use loudspeaker eq to manage the loudspeaker in the space for more on this approach see this article http //www prosoundweb com/channels/church/eq boot camp a regimented approach to effective equalization/ and this video by dave rat http //www youtube com/watch v cu9bmupc62c now practically if that's all you have at your disposal obviously you want to use it but i try to adhere to strict eq discipline whenever possible which keep thing nice and organized and pay off in spade on larger more complex system the bigger and more practical issue is that i don't want to use a preset unless i understand what it's doing to my signal this is the big distinction between the artistic and the technical it's perfectly acceptable in my view for an artist to be ignorant of what's happening under the hood a long a they're getting the desired result not so for an engineer another good example of this is an enhancer plugin or any sort of magic black box process lot of these exist they all claim to make it sound better but don't elaborate on how if you're a musician and you want to use it for artistic reason because you like the way it sound go nut but a a system tech i have full responsibility for the signal chain and everything in it so if i can't tell you what the device is doing to my signal i'm not going to put it in the signal chain this isn't about condemning certain product it's about educating myself about what those product do and then making an informed decision a to whether or not it's appropriate in the situation in this specific application the box in question are destined for use a low profile monitor in a small okay tiny club here's how the two stage monitor eq presets affect the response http //imgur com/fcnb3kk http //imgur com/fcnb3kk yikes i'm concerned about the gain reduction and i'm not particularly excited about the 1k and 12k peak either but my primarly

vocal mics the install itself is going to have to happen in a very small time window because the club ha scheduled event so my strategy wa to get thing a close to dialed in a possible while still at the shop once i get into the room next week i should be in the ballpark only needing to adjust for the effect of the specific acoustic environment a theme in common with my previous post note that we

i'v been use the peavi pr12 yamaha dxr and macki thump in the past for the band never realli own speaker i'v look around and the band is consid a big jump into better speaker as we'r start to pick up show we'r still stuck between a few speaker yamaha dsr qsc k12 2 along with a sub still look around the fact stand that these are huge invest for us to be honest i do not know much on how to maintain speaker and make them last / i want to make sure when we buy the speaker that the band ha a gener educ on safeti speaker so you know the head doesn't blow out at the veri least i understand that make sure mixer is turn off when no one is play in case a player unplug their instrument cabl minim feedback don't overdr speaker and leav headroom here are my questions/concern 1 sinc i'm look at power speaker what doe watt and ohm have to do with activ speaker i keep read that under power amp can clip the amp but if i'm use power speaker where do amp watt and ohm play into thi i think thi is more of an issu for passiv speaker 2 with the speaker i'v use in the past i'v had to push my fader to the max and gain on the speaker for some outdoor event in hindsight i might have been push the speaker to the limit leav littl headroom is there a way to reduc that i'm more concern about sound output for some event that are outdoor and less than 500 peopl with the dsr or qsc k12 2s i don't think sound output is an issu so i wouldn't need to push my fader and speaker to the max 3 for smaller event should i still use the dsrs/qsc or should i tri to ask the venue/friend if they have smaller one my concern is use the speaker too much could caus them to wear down not sure if that is a correct assumpt 4 how import is the warranti do speaker break down easili if i could get them on ebay/refurbish for cheaper rather than through an author seller with warranti i would to save a few hundr dollar speaker seem kinda fragil to me and i don't want to damag a high invest item compar to comput which are more meant to be overclock it seem like push speaker to their limit will kill it i want to be abl to utilize/optim the speaker to their fullest potenti but leav headroom seem to be more ideal ani

first off i apologis if thi is a dumb question i feel i'm look for someth that doesn't exist but i honestli don't know what to look up to get an answer in the first place a coupl of the band i perform with are look to expand their setup for iem and the like in an ideal world that mean rack mount transmitt and audio interfac a mixer for iem mayb a kemper in there you get the idea in both case each band member would be respons for their part of the setup i'v just bought a wireless transmitter/receiv myself the issu i have is that i am by no mean a wealthi person and i can't realli afford to buy doubl of everyth for both of my band also think long term there might be time i want to remov the transmitt or take the kemper out on it own thi mean that rack mount isn't a great option but i realli want a way of make sure that when i do play with these band we can transport all the gear secur and when we get to the venu we can still plonk our system on stage power it on and everything' sort the tl dr is basic is there a way of get the best of both world here have all the gear set up nice and secur for show while also allow me to easili remov my stuff my onli guess is some kind of clamp rack than use screw or i just get a rack for myself to put on top of the 'band rack' and suck it up when i need to take it apart but i just don't know ani advic would be appreci,question about equip transport and rack mount 'alternatives',first off i apologise if this is a dumb question i feel i'm looking for something that doesn't exist but i honestly don't know what to look up to get an answer in the first place a couple of the band i perform with are looking to expand their setup for iems and the like in an ideal world that mean rack mounted transmitter and audio interface a mixer for iems maybe a kemper in there you get the idea in both case each band member would be responsible for their part of the setup i've just bought a wireless transmitter/receiver myself the issue i have is that i am by no mean a wealthy person and i can't really afford to buy double of everything for both of my band also thinking long term there might be time i want to remove the transmitter or take the kemper out on it own this mean that rack mounted isn't a great option but i really want a way of making sure that when i do play with these band we can transport all the gear securely and when we get to the venue we can still plonk our system on stage power it on and everything's sorted the tl dr is basically is there a way of getting the best of both world here have all the gear set up nicely and securely for show while also allowing me to easily remove my stuff my only guess is some kind of clamp rack than using screw or i just get a rack for myself to put on top of the 'band rack' and suck it up when i need to take it apart but i just don't know any advice would be appreciated,question about equipment transportation and rack mounting 'alternatives',1

splay give us 48 of coverag http //imgur com/rcmo0yn http //imgur com/rcmo0yn i didn't take the time to add big bold line for the coverag line but you can clearli see the seat shape the gif anim show the predict on octav center from 250 hz to 8 khz thi is a symmetr array that creat a complet symmetr coverag pattern note that due to the symmetri we know that the geometr center of thi array between box 6 and 7 is on axi onax for all frequenc that seem obviou now but file it away the problem is that the desir coverag area is not symmetr everyon will hear the show but the folk in the front are go

posit is the mainstay of the eq process and thi is where we run into problem where is onax http //imgur com/p0iuf0a http //imgur com/p0iuf0a the main coverag lobe the loudest point along the coverag angl now shift over frequenc whi thi happen is not a quick explan but it ha to do with the amount of direct control the array as a whole and the individu box can exert over differ wavelength as frequenc fall wavelength get longer and the direct in which the box is point matter less and less the takeaway here is that we no longer have anywher to place the refer mic that is repres of the array as a whole and thu no firm basi on which to make effect eq decis thi is not the fault of autosplay rather it' the consequ of have an asymmetr array shape creat by autosplay so let' skip the autosplay and come up with our own splay angl the follow is heavili base on the mccarthi / meyer approach with a few littl adapt of my own for the full stori read bob' book http //www amazon com/sound system optim techniqu alignment/dp/0415731011/ref sr_1_1 ie utf8 qid 1542162504 sr 8 1 keyword bob mccarthi sound system design and optim the idea behind an articul line array is that we can use overlap coverag of adjac box to creat summat and offset the level varianc we need more level toward the back so we want more overlap toward the top of the array how much more rang ratio wa 3 1 so let' use three time as much overlap at the top put anoth way a ratio of 1 3 between the angl at the top and bottom of the array in theori thi offset the rang ratio although thi is one of the area where i depart from bob mccarthy' guidelin i find that a splay ratio 30 50 larger reduc the amount of shade i need later if we divid the array into composit and we keep each composit symmetr we can solo each section of the array and know exactli where onax is for all frequenc no differ than work with a singl loudspeak then we just combin them and use eq to compens for the combin effect name lf buildup and we'r good to go the top composit need to go further so in gener they should consist of more box at smaller splay angl out of my 12 box i did four composit a b c and d there' a littl guess test and revis base on the angl your particular system can actual hit but let' go with a 4 box 2 for a total of 8 b 3 2 for a total of 6 c 3 4 for a total of 12 and final d 2 8 for a total of 16 that give me a grand total of 42 of coverag plu the fring that extend past the onax of the topmost and bottommost box there' no magic here just keep push and pull and obey the guidelin of fewer box per composit at larger angl as we go down when we translat that into interbox angl which we need to give the softwar and the rigger we get 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 4 6 8 the parenthes indic interbox angl within each composit a for exampl ha 4 box and therefor three interbox angl and the transit splay angl between composit are visibl between the group anoth brilliant convent of bob' that we can't fulli dive into here the trend are observ fewer box at wider splay as we go down and the bottom splay is 4 time the top splay so we'v more than offset the rang ratio each symmetr element then ha a clearli defin onax at all

an even lower varianc coverag scenario http //imgur com/ocptjrh http //imgur com/ocptjrh befor we head to cater let' address the shade issu there' sometim a concern about how much headroom is lost by

headroom noth to be scare of,between the line 3 how to find line array splay angl,i know i know i just posted i'm preparing a powerpoint presentation so i figured i'd kill two bird with one stone after this post i'll shut up for a while when preparing the configuration of a line array technically an asymmetrical composite coupled point source i start with three piece of information 1 what is the desired coverage angle from the loudspeaker's point of view the angle from the last row to the front row 2 what is the range ratio how far the top box need to throw to the last coverage row divided by how far the bottom box need to throw to the first coverage row 3 how many box are in the hang and what splay angle setting are available in the example i've made up the coverage angle is about 45 and i've given myself a budget of 12 box http //imgur com/fk1kigp http //imgur com/fk1kigp the absolute throw distance are not nearly a important a the relationship between them in this case it's 2 9 time farther to the last seat than the first seat let's start with a big ole' constant curvature source and just cover the angle 12 box at 4 splay give u 48 of coverage http //imgur

center from 250 hz to 8 khz this is a symmetrical array that creates a completely symmetrical coverage pattern note that due to the symmetry we know that the geometrical center of this array between box 6 and 7 is on axis onax for all frequency that seems obvious now but file it away the problem is that the desired coverage area is not symmetrical everyone will hear the show but the folk in the front are going to hear it about 9 db louder than the folk in the back we know this thanks to the inverse squared law for a range ratio of 2 9 20log 2 9/1 9 db what about autosplay the software give

lobe the loudest point along the coverage angle now shift over frequency why this happens is not a quick explanation but it ha to do with the amount of directional control the array a a whole and the individual box can exert over different wavelength a frequency fall wavelength get longer and the direction in which the box is pointed matter le and le the takeaway here is that we no longer have anywhere to place the reference mic that is representative of the array a a whole and thus no firm basis on which to make effective eq decision this is not the fault of autosplay rather it's the consequence of having an asymmetrical array shape created by autosplay so let's skip the autosplay and come up with our own splay angle the following is heavily based on the mccarthy / meyer approach with a few little adaptation of my own for the full story read bob's book http //www amazon com/sound system optimization technique alignment/dp/0415731011/ref sr_1_1 ie utf8 qid 1542162504 sr 8 1 keywords bob mccarthy sound system design and optimization the idea behind an articulated line array is that we can use overlapping coverage of adjacent box to create summation and offset the level variance we need more level towards the back so we want more overlap towards the top of the array how much more range ratio wa 3 1 so let's use three time a much overlap at the top put another way a ratio of 1 3 between the angle at the top and bottom of the array in theory this offset the range ratio although this is one of the area where i depart from bob mccarthy's guideline i find that a splay ratio 30 50 larger reduces the amount of shading i need later if we divide the array into composite and we keep each composite symmetrical we can solo each section of the array and know exactly where onax is for all frequency no different than working with a single loudspeaker then we just combine them and use eq to compensate for the combination effect namely lf buildup and we're good to go the top composite need to go further so in general they should consist of more box at smaller splay angle out of my 12 box i did four composite a b c and d there's a little guess test and revise based

of splay are practically ignored some platform allow a little all pas steering here but even without it we have a very well behaved pa system one last note it's a bit hot down in front so after doing what we can with splay a little shading can go a long way taking the bottom two composite bottom 5 box down by 3 db result in an even lower variance coverage scenario http //imgur com/ocptjrh http //imgur com/ocptjrh before we head to catering let's address the shading issue there's sometimes a concern about how much headroom is lost by turning some of the box down the box have the most overlap at lf so that's where the largest potential loss would occur in this case taking 5 out of 12 box down by 3 db creates a loss of just over 1 db of lf headroom nothing to be scared of,between the line 3

hi all read on for part 2 of the same system we were look at the other day interest applic as it' a listen room so we'r onli concern about the system respons at a singl point in space thi side step a

com/r/livesound/comments/9vv55w/between_the_lines_1_interpreting_the_phase_trace/ i'm go to start by just look at the left side on it own there' a great debat over whether a sound system' frequenc respons should be flat or tilt and then how much tilt and what corner frequenc and on and on for a varieti of opinion see thi roundtabl articl http //www prosoundweb com/channels/l sound/flat or tilt a varieti of approach to the system tune process/ also check out thi articl on the subject by foh engin jim yakabuski http //www prosoundweb com/channels/l sound/backstag class a tune standard/ i am fortun to call jim a friend and we'v had mani convers about thi particular topic for me person it depend on what the system will be use for speech or music as well as the local acoust environ how much lf buildup the room will contribut ultim thi question will be answer by listen to refer record and tweak the tilt until it sound correct then that becom the target curv to which i'll match the rest of the system rest of the system in thi case mean the other side the initi respons actual had a slight upward tilt to it look at 3 khz and up http //imgur com/a9e7pax http //imgur com/a9e7pax thi is partli becaus the room is small enough that a lot of the hf bounc off the wall and ceil show up in the measur notic poor coher and also partli becaus we'r onli about 15 feet away from a rel larg loudspeak that' design to throw a lot farther than across a live room so there' not nearli as much hf air attenu as we would see further back in it intend applic thi make sens but it sound quit bad as confirm by listen to my refer music so let' fix that http //imgur com/3aoras9 http //imgur com/3aoras9 pink pre eq raw respons blue post eq now hold your hors i'm sure you are wonder about that 63 hz peak and i'll get there i use a hi shelf filter at 3 khz to get rid of that upward tilt and a cut at around 400 hz to rein in that midrang bump that might be a lobe from the crossov it' a 15 system and the listen posit is vertic below onax but 400 still seem low to me or it might be a modal thing the deep narrow cancel on either side lend credenc to both hypothes and sinc they'r cancel you can't eq them back up to normal to a first approxim that is true if it is modal good acoust treatment can do a world of good but that' not within the scope of the job okay so for the 63 hz issu thi look surprisingli similar to the sub bump that you see on a modern larg format pa system out of the box see thi imag http //imgur com/iubw6nt if it look familiar it' becaus it' from the same setup as pictur in the jim yak articl i link abov jim snap it on hi phone it show hi k2 rig out of the box with sub mute and there' still a heck of an lf bump hi magnitud trace is bottom pane which is the smaart default sinc thi system is primarili go to be use for the owner to play loud rock music i left it we'r run without sub here so thi is actual an impress show it didn't sound reson or honki dure playback if it end up be too much we can alway go back and roll it back but i suspect it will work out well for the owner of the system thi is a judgement call though so there' no right or wrong just what' best for the situat usual we also feed the output of the dsp into the analyz so we can see the eq curv on the screen as well while thi is extrem help it' not strictli necessari and in thi case it' not possibl sinc the dsp is onboard the activ loudspeak so here we just see the befor and after respons i'll includ a screenshot of the final filter set from the dsp at the end so you can see the filter i use the appli eq look like a rel minor chang on the screen but boy did it sound a whole lot better i'm use 1/12 oct averag which is lower resolut than i usual prefer but becaus of the low coher and nasti room problem more averag clarifi the gener trend for me in thi case we'r deal in broad stroke here not tri to go in and equal everi singl littl bump for a varieti of reason the small scale detail tend not to be veri audibl wherea the ear is incred respons to the wideband stuff for exampl after listen the hf still sound too bright and one more db on the shelf work wonder so by focus on the broad stroke we can make some realli big improv with rel few gentl filter note the phase respons befor and after is almost ident the filter here are so low q that there' virtual no chang thi would not be the case for realli narrow high q filter which are all too often adopt by the autoeq plugin etc the phase shift itself is of cours not audibl but the reson certainli can be now let' go back and see the post eq left compar to the right channel http //imgur com/i7egjbx http //imgur com/i7egjbx the match phase trace indic match arriv time at the listen posit see part 1 and so look next at the magnitud trace on top we can see further issu the right loudspeak brown trace is significantli louder than the left side if it' within a db it' noth to write home about but these graph have a vertic scale of 3 db / divis so what we'r see here is signific it' also audibl it' import to alway check these thing as we go a simpl listen test can prevent you from make bad decis base on improp or incomplet data it' import to rememb that the analyz simpli give us more data and it' up to us to interpret that data and make an inform decis so we need a gain chang how much it' easi to offset trace in the softwar until they line up in thi case it end up be 4 db that' larger than a manufactur toler so befor crank the gain in dsp it help to actual determin what the issu is in thi case one of the input gain block in the loudspeaker' onboard dsp wa set incorrectli and after remov the attenu l and r line up just fine http //imgur com/oyege6o http //imgur com/oyege6o right' just a smidg higher but that' okay becaus we'r look at it unequ respons vs left' equal respons sinc most of the eq work will be subtract thi is noth to be concern about right side eq choic were similarli

match in a tonal sens the eq necessari for thi wa asymmetr becaus the room itself as well as the loudspeakers' placement within is also asymmetr http //imgur com/yuvcze4 http //imgur com/yuvcze4 focu on the white line becaus even bypass filter contribut to the blue shade for some reason note that the macro trend are the same gentl cut in the lo mid and the hf i end up with two cascad hf shelf cut to get it to sound right up top again the analyz cannot provid thi data trust your ear but then look at the analyz so we can correl what we'r see with what sound good i know there are some other system tech hide in the weed out there and everyone' got their own recip so by all mean all correct / comment / altern interpret are welcom also hey i do thi for a live so if anyon is interest in have

for speech or music a well a the local acoustic environment how much lf buildup the room will contribute ultimately this question will be answered by listening to reference recording and tweaking the tilt until it sound correct then that becomes the target curve to which i'll match the rest of the system rest of the system in this case mean the other side the initial response actually had a slight upward tilt to it look at 3 khz and up http //imgur com/a9e7pax http //imgur com/a9e7pax this is partly because the room is small enough that a lot of the hf bouncing off the wall and ceiling show up in the measurement notice poor coherence and also partly because we're only about 15 foot away from a relatively large loudspeaker that's designed to throw a lot farther than across a living room so there's not nearly a much hf air attenuation a we would see further back in it intended application this make sense but it sounded quite bad a confirmed by listening to my reference music so let's fix that http //imgur com/3aoras9 http //imgur com/3aoras9 pink pre eq raw response blue post eq now hold your horse i'm sure you are wondering about that 63 hz peak and i'll get there i used a hi shelf filter at 3 khz to get rid of that upward tilt and a cut at around 400 hz to rein in that midrange bump that might be a lobe from the crossover it's a 15 system and the listening position is

eq them back up to normal to a first approximation that is true if it is modal good acoustic treatment can do a world of good but that's not within the scope of the job okay so for the 63 hz issue this look surprisingly similar to the sub bump that you see on a modern large format pa system out of the box see this image http //imgur com/iubw6nt if it look familiar it's because it's from the same setup a pictured in the jim yak article i linked above jim snapped it on his phone it show his k2 rig out of the box with sub muted and there's still a heck of an lf bump his magnitude trace is bottom pane which is the smaart default since this system is primarily going to be used for the owner to play loud rock music i left it we're running without sub here so this is actually an impressive showing it didn't sound resonant or honky during playback if it end up being too much we can always go back and roll it back but i suspect it will work out well for the owner of the system this is a judgement call though so there's no right or wrong just what's best for the situation usually we also feed the output of the dsp into the analyzer so we can see the eq curve on the screen a well while this is extremely helpful it's not strictly necessary and in this case it's not possible since the dsp is onboard the active loudspeaker so here we just see the before and after response i'll include a screenshot of the final filter setting from the dsp at the end so you can see the filter i used the applied eq look like a relatively minor change on the screen but boy did it sound a whole lot better i'm using 1/12 oct averaging which is lower resolution than i usually prefer but because of the low coherence and nasty room problem more averaging clarified the general trend for me in this case we're dealing in broad stroke here not trying to go in and equalize every single little bump for a variety of reason the small scale detail tend not to be very audible whereas the ear is incredibly responsive to the wideband stuff for example after listening the hf still sounded too bright and one more db on the shelf worked wonder so by focusing on the broad stroke we can make some really big improvement with relatively few gentle filter note the phase response before and after is almost identical the filter here are so low q that there's virtually no change this would not be the case for really narrow high q filter which are all too often adopted by the autoeq plugins etc the phase shift itself is of course not audible but the resonance certainly can be now let's go back and see the post eq left compared to the right channel http //imgur com/i7egjbx http //imgur com/i7egjbx the matched phase trace indicate matched arrival time at the listening position see part 1 and so looking next at the magnitude trace on top we can see further issue the right loudspeaker brown trace is significantly louder than the left side if it's within a db it's nothing to write home about but these graph have a vertical scaling of 3 db / division so what we're seeing here is significant it's also audible it's important to always check these thing a we go a simple listening test can prevent you from making bad decision based on improper or incomplete data it's important to remember that the analyzer simply give u more data and it's up to u to interpret that data and make an informed decision so we need a gain change how much it's easy to offset trace in the software until they line up in this case it ended up being 4 db that's larger than a manufacturing tolerance so before cranking the gain in dsp it help to actually determine what the issue is in this case one of the input gain block in the loudspeaker's onboard dsp wa set incorrectly and after removing the attenuation l and r lined up just fine http //imgur com/oyege6o http //imgur com/oyege6o right's just a smidge higher but that's okay because we're looking at it unequalized response v left's equalized response since most of the eq work will be subtractive this is nothing to be concerned about right side eq choice were similarly sparing http //imgur com/qzdcjwt http //imgur com/qzdcjwt red trace is post eq and here's l and r together http //imgur com/t62cyvt http //imgur com/t62cyvt considering the bad room l and r are pretty well matched in a tonal sense the eq necessary for this wa asymmetrical because the room itself a well a the loudspeakers' placement within is also asymmetrical http //imgur com/yuvcze4 http //imgur com/yuvcze4 focus on the white line because even bypassed filter contribute to the blue shading for some reason note that the macro trend are the same gentle cut in the lo mid and the hf i ended up with two cascaded hf shelf cut to get it to sound right up top again the analyzer cannot provide this data trust your ear but then look at the analyzer so we can correlate what we're seeing with what sound good i know there are some other system tech hiding in the weed out there and everyone's got their own recipe so by all mean all correction / comment / alternate interpretation are welcome also hey i do this for a living so if anyone is interested in

it' possibl that thi exist and i'm not awar of it so pleas forgiv me in that case to clarifi what i mean by daw consol when you set up a studio or live record you'll gener have a daw and a consol that interfac with it that creat a redund situat becaus daw will typic have a virtual mixer that ha basic all the same function of your physic mix consol even with a simpl audio interfac without full channel process you'll usual still have rout option that oper independ from the intern rout in your daw and preamp that need to be control separ what i think would be interest is a consol that' essenti a glorifi audio interfac daw control with digit control preamp that are control from within the softwar all surfac control actual control your daw' virtual mixer and all rout mirror your daw rout the softwar could be a special version of protools/cubase/etc that' meant to be control with thi mixer the mix engin would be a power comput that' dedic to run the daw at low latenc you can then run all your favourit vst and plugin dure live perform and you can record multitrack and play thing back easili i hope thi make sens let me know what you think doe that exist,whi is there no daw consol,it's possible that this exists and i'm not aware of it so please forgive me in that case to clarify what i mean by daw console when you set up a studio or live recording you'll generally have a daw and a console that interface with it that creates a redundant situation because daw will typically have a virtual mixer that ha basically all the same functionality of your physical mixing console even with a simple audio interface without full channel processing you'll usually still have routing option that operate independently from the internal routing in your daw and preamps that need to be controlled separately what i think would be interesting is a console that's essentially a glorified audio interface daw controller with digitally controlled preamps that are controlled from within the software all surface control actually control your daw's virtual mixer and all routing mirror your daw routing the software could be a specialized version of protools/cubase/etc that's meant to be controlled with this mixer the mix engine would be a powerful computer that's dedicated to running the daw at low latency you can then run all your favourite vsts and plugins during live performance and you can record multitrack and play thing back easily i hope this make sense let me know what you think doe that exist,why is there no daw console,1

welcom to what i plan to be a seri of post show analyz trace from the wild as well as an explan of what inform i glean from that data and how it inform my decis in the field base on my last post http //www reddit com/r/livesound/comments/9vac2i/system_optimization_qa/ it seem like some more technic writeup might be relev to thi commun i would welcom some feedback as to whether thi is the case if for no other reason than write them up is time consum okay then onto the good stuff i'm start with a common topic of confus what the heck is thi phase respons trace tell us well it tell us a lot of thing but one aspect of it is someth like ask the question what point in it cycl wa thi frequenc at when the measur wa taken for a singl frequenc thi tell us just about noth but when observ over a frequenc rang we can glean a lot of use inform for us we need to look for trend here is a veri basic rule of thumb that cover a lot of the common phase trace question 1 the steeper the phase trace slope the more time offset exist 2 if the slope is descend left to right the arriv is late if the slope is ascend left to right the arriv is earli let me be clear the phase trace indic lot of differ thing but thi simpl concept will get you some clariti in a lot of situat let' see some exampl http //imgur com/e1cauez http //imgur com/e1cauez here is a trace taken dure the benchtest of a system processor note that i person choos to view magnitud respons on top and phase respons on the bottom thi is the opposit of the default view in smaart so just be awar of that there' a few thing to point out here 1 the phase trace is descend left to right so it' indic a late arriv as i mention abov in thi particular case i simpli hadn't yet ad delay to the analyz to compens for the device' latenc the trace get steeper with frequenc becaus the same amount of time offset will caus more phase offset at higher frequenc becaus those cycl happen faster thi is linear we have twice as much phase offset at 1k as we do at 500 hz becaus the cycl take half the time the slope appear to be increas becaus of the log frequenc axi if you were to view the phase trace on a linear frequenc axi it would be a constant slope if you have rew which you should becaus it' free give it a tri 2 look at the magnitud display we see that the coher the red line across the top drop abov 10 khz and the associ frequenc respons data is no bueno thi is becaus the time delay is so much that at these frequenc the inform come back outsid the time window and therefor is not consid to correl with the refer signal think about an echo that take a week to come back it no longer correl with what we yell to caus the echo and so it' now nois that' what the coher trace show us how confid it is in the answer it' give put anoth way is the frequenc respons thi way becaus it' relat to the refer signal or is there just nois in the room that ha noth to do with our test signal how do we tell hvac from lf pink nois the analyz will do the same calcul a bunch of time and averag the result over success measur return the same answer over and over is high coher if it' wander around or what the mic is pick up doesn't seem to be relat to the signal we'r send out coher drop we can actual figur out how much delay we'r deal with by do a littl math the first wraparound pass through 0 again at just about 1 khz so we'v gone 360 one cycl back over a 1000 hz rang 1/1000 1 ms thi trick is more or less what we'r ask the analyz to do if we view a group delay plot let' enabl that option http //imgur com/v5srypi http //imgur com/v5srypi and there you have it a solid line at about 1 ms if the phase shift is caus by someth other than a linear time offset thi will not be a flat line so be care make infer about the entir frequenc range' delay base on use onli two point for the manual mental calcul if you'r wonder what those littl wiggl are i can't say for certain but my hypothesi is that those are the point at which the fft switch to a differ time window length mayb someon can enlighten me so let' look at how we might actual use thi knowledg in the wild thi imag show measur taken of two speaker left and right in a small home audio listen room with nasti acoust but that' anoth topic http //imgur com/lmhdahb http //imgur com/lmhdahb we have a few problem here but direct your attent to the phase trace at the listen posit where thi measur wa taken one of the speaker is arriv earlier becaus it' closer which one that would be the thicker teal trace becaus it ha a steeper slope more time offset and it' ascend from left to right earli arriv we have to look at the hf here becaus the lf ha the normal descend trend associ with lf driver and we'v got some bad modal issu interf we do a whole wrap whole cycl between 2k and 3k so let' add a millisecond delay to that channel in the dsp http //imgur com/aygedu3 http //imgur com/aygedu3 much better in a larg venu situat larger than one listen thi is close enough for show busi becaus move over one seat will result in a complet differ result but thi is a listen room and we know exactli where the listen is go to be sit so let' get closer we'r about 90 degre off at 8 khz a full cycl at 8 khz is 125 ms so we don't need much delay to fix thi in fact a quarter cycl 90 would be 31 microsecond heh so let' chang our delay to 95 ms and see if we miss it the other way http //imgur com/g9bgjga http //imgur com/g9bgjga we do inde the final solut end up be 0 954m http //imgur com/i7egjbx http //imgur com/i7egjbx i could have actual lock in all the way up to 16 khz given a dsp with suffici delay resolut but the distanc between the listener' ear is multipl wavelength at these frequenc so drill down ani further is arguabl pointless sinc both ear can't even perceiv the benefit plu i wa readi for my lunch break at that point hope thi wa help and not just a wast of my time i can't say how often i'll be abl to do writeup becaus i you know work and i realli like video game but happi to answer ani relev question about audio not video game edit sorri left out first imag fix,between the line 1 interpret the phase trace,welcome to what i plan to be a series of post showing analyzer trace from the wild a well a an explanation of what information i gleaned from that data and how it informed my decision in the field based on my last post http //www reddit com/r/livesound/comments/9vac2i/system_optimization_qa/ it seems like some more technical writeups might be relevant to this community i would welcome some feedback a to whether this is the case if for no other reason than writing them up is time consuming okay then onto the good stuff i'm starting with a common topic of confusion what the heck is this phase response trace telling u well it tell u a lot of thing but one aspect of it is something like asking the question what point in it cycle wa this frequency at when the measurement wa taken for a single frequency this tell u just about nothing but when observed over a frequency range we can glean a lot of useful information for u we need to look for trend here is a very basic rule of thumb that cover a lot of the common phase trace question 1 the steeper the phase trace slope the more time offset exists 2 if the slope is descending left to right the arrival is late if the slope is ascending left to right the arrival is early let me be clear the phase trace indicates lot of different thing but this simple concept will get you some clarity in a lot of situation let's see some example http //imgur com/e1cauez http //imgur com/e1cauez here is a trace taken during the benchtesting of a system processor note that i personally choose to view magnitude response on top and phase response on the bottom this is the opposite of the default view in smaart so just be aware of that there's a few thing to point out here 1 the phase trace is descending left to right so it's indicating a late arrival a i mentioned above in this particular case i simply hadn't yet added delay to the analyzer to compensate for the device's latency the trace get steeper with frequency because the same amount of time offset will cause more phase offset at higher frequency because those cycle happen faster this is linear we have twice a much phase offset at 1k a we do at 500 hz because the cycle take half the time the slope appears to be increasing because of the log frequency axis if you were to view the phase trace on a linear frequency axis it would be a constant slope if you have rew which you should because it's free give it a try 2 looking at the magnitude display we see that the coherence the red line across the top drop above 10 khz and the associated frequency response data is no bueno this is because the time delay is so much that at these frequency the information come back outside the time window and therefore is not considered to correlate with the reference signal think about an echo that take a week to come back it no longer correlate with what we yelled to cause the echo and so it's now noise that's what the coherence trace show u how confident it is in the answer it's giving put another way is the frequency response this way because it's related to the reference signal or is there just noise in the room that ha nothing to do with our test signal how do we tell hvac from lf pink noise the analyzer will do the same calculation a bunch of time and average the result over successive measurement returning the same answer over and over is high coherence if it's wandering around or what the mic is picking up doesn't seem to be related to the signal we're sending out coherence drop we can actually figure out how much delay we're dealing with by doing a little math the first wraparound pass through 0 again at just about 1 khz so we've gone 360 one cycle back over a 1000 hz range 1/1000 1 m this trick is more or le what we're asking the analyzer to do if we view a group delay plot let's enable that option http //imgur com/v5srypi http //imgur com/v5srypi and there you have it a solid line at about 1 m if the phase shift is caused by something other than a linear time offset this will not be a flat line so be careful making inference about the entire frequency range's delay based on using only two point for the manual mental calculation if you're wondering what those little wiggle are i can't say for certain but my hypothesis is that those are the point at which the fft switch to a different time window length maybe someone can enlighten me so let's look at how we might actually use this knowledge in the wild this image show measurement taken of two speaker left and right in a small home audio listening room with nasty acoustic but that's another topic http //imgur com/lmhdahb http //imgur com/lmhdahb we have a few problem here but direct your attention to the phase trace at the listening position where this measurement wa taken one of the speaker is arriving earlier because it's closer which one that would be the thicker teal trace because it ha a steeper slope more time offset and it's ascending from left to right early arrival we have to look at the hf here because the lf ha the normal descending trend associated with lf driver and we've got some bad modal issue interfering we do a whole wrap whole cycle between 2k and 3k so let's add a millisecond delay to that channel in the dsp http //imgur com/aygedu3 http //imgur com/aygedu3 much better in a large venue situation larger than one listener this is close enough for show business because moving over one seat will result in a completely different result but this is a listening room and we know exactly where the listener is going to be sitting so let's get closer we're about 90 degree off at 8 khz a full cycle at 8 khz is 125 m so we don't need much delay to fix this in fact a quarter cycle 90 would be 31 microsecond heh so let's change our delay to 95 m and see if we miss it the other way http //imgur com/g9bgjga http //imgur com/g9bgjga we do indeed the final solution ended up being 0 954ms http //imgur com/i7egjbx http //imgur com/i7egjbx i could have actually locked in all the way up to 16 khz given a dsp with sufficient delay resolution but the distance between the listener's ear is multiple wavelength at these frequency so drilling down any further is arguably pointless since both ear can't even perceive the benefit plus i wa ready for my lunch break at that point hopefully this wa helpful and not just a waste of my time i can't say how often i'll be able to do writeups because i you know work and i really like video game but happy to answer any relevant question about audio not video game edit sorry left out first image fixed,between the line 1

i'm look for a new wireless microphon system to recommend for a low budget oper we typic use 11 mic per show and 2 handheld 8 of which are age and also affect by the 600mhz spectrum realloc as for the other 3 1 of them is a 2000 seri audio technica that happen to be i band so isn't affect the rest were d band and the remain 2 are new shure blx system we bought last year a t hadn't updat their line in a long while and when they final did they made a new connector that seemingli isn't compat with ani mic they don't make themselv the blx system seem nice enough better than the old system for sure but the cheaper materi and the non remov yet flexibl antenna make me nervou about their longev they also seem quit hot sound wise last year though i'm still think there' someth on our end we'r miss on that front plan to do some experiment regard that gain issu thi thanksgiv befor audit time to see if it improv all in all they work well enough but we want them to last as long as we can i think i can get away with push a higher end offer if they'll work better or last longer but there' no way we can jump up to a qlx/ulx or someth that costli i wa then look to see if shure offer a mid market option and they do but it wa a 2 4ghz system and i quickli dismiss thi howev their new advanc system is caus me to give it anoth look they claim to handl up to 11 channel and if we keep blx for part of our setup the thought is we could have 6 or so run on glx reliabl thi would allow us to have more rf spectrum to work with to coordin our other mic as we tour around those system appear to be better made the batteri system also look to be a huge conveni never have to worri about batteri die in show or convinc someon to go run to walmart for more again with time remain indic and a recharg spare right in the receiv and they'll never be affect by futur fcc spectrum chang but that said at the end of the day they have to work and while we'r mostli perform away from dens wi fi area i don't want there to be a major problem with the mani wireless devic our team actor and audienc use tech crew often sit in audienc area our tech setup is somewher around 40 50' from the stage our snake is 50' long so it shouldn't ever be much further back than that again we sit in the audienc and have the antenna clear the audienc ha been an issu befor with uhf and i wonder if 2 4 will make that wors ha anyon tri thi use the glx d adv frequenc manag with the stock antenna i would expect it to work with the paddl becaus they'r direct but becaus of our quick setup tour and budget focus natur ad the time and cost expens of set up paddl antenna right up by the stage probabl wouldn't be worth it i'm also interest if there are other option anyon may recommend in that sort of price rang right now i'm still lean toward just push to get more blx system becaus it' still cheaper and doesn't have 2 4g problem but if there' a better but still cost practic way i'd love to hear it thank for ani info tl dr we are replac our mic system blx in earli test had some problem and concern but not terribl is glx d adv worth the upgrad or will it caus even more problem and is there a better option to consid thank,shure blx vs glx d advanc or other budget option,i'm looking for a new wireless microphone system to recommend for a low budget operation we typically use 11 mics per show and 2 handhelds 8 of which are aging and also affected by the 600mhz spectrum reallocation a for the other 3 1 of them is a 2000 series audio technica that happened to be i band so isn't affected the rest were d band and the remaining 2 are new shure blx system we bought last year a t hadn't updated their line in a long while and when they finally did they made a new connector that seemingly isn't compatible with any mics they don't make themselves the blx system seem nice enough better than the old system for sure but the cheaper material and the non removable yet flexible antenna make me nervous about their longevity they also seemed quite hot sound wise last year though i'm still thinking there's something on our end we're missing on that front planning to do some experimentation regarding that gain issue this thanksgiving before audition time to see if it improves all in all they work well enough but we want them to last a long a we can i think i can get away with pushing a higher end offering if they'll work better or last longer but there's no way we can jump up to a qlx/ulx or something that costly i wa then looking to see if shure offered a mid market option and they do but it wa a 2 4ghz system and i quickly dismissed this however their new advanced system is causing me to give it another look they claim to handle up to 11 channel and if we keep blx for part of our setup the thought is we could have 6 or so running on glx reliably this would allow u to have more rf spectrum to work with to coordinate our other mics a we tour around those system appear to be better made the battery system also look to be a huge convenience never having to worry about battery dying in show or convincing someone to go running to walmart for more again with time remaining indicator and a rechargeable spare right in the receiver and they'll never be affected by future fcc spectrum change but that said at the end of the day they have to work and while we're mostly performing away from dense wi fi area i don't want there to be a major problem with the many wireless device our team actor and audience us tech crew often sits in audience area our tech setup is somewhere around 40 50' from the stage our snake is 50' long so it shouldn't ever be much further back than that again we sit in the audience and having the antenna clear the audience ha been an issue before with uhf and i wonder if 2 4 will make that worse ha anyone tried this using the glx d adv frequency manager with the stock antenna i would expect it to work with the paddle because they're directional but because of our quick setup touring and budget focused nature adding the time and cost expense of setting up paddle antenna right up by the stage probably wouldn't be worth it i'm also interested if there are other option anyone may recommend in that sort of price range right now i'm still leaning toward just pushing to get more blx system because it's still cheaper and doesn't have 2 4g problem but if there's a better but still cost practical way i'd love to hear it thanks for any info tl dr we are replacing our mic system blx in early testing had some problem and concern but not terrible is glx d adv worth the upgrade or will it cause even more problem and is there a better option to consider thanks,shure blx v glx d advanced or other budget option,1

long post sorri if thi is a bit too guitar base of a question to be ask here but it doe concern my hope to set up a work multi amp rig for live perform without caus horribl sound hum that would annoy an audienc and as much as i love /r/guitar i feel like all of you brilliant folk here might have more understand of the technic end of thi issu i'v notic that variou player with realli big guitar sound like adam jone of tool have multi amp setup even guy like zakk wyld use a choru pedal with multipl amp to thicken their sound at the moment i have a boss dd 6 delay with stereo out and i'm look to add a boss choru pedal and boss reverb pedal with stereo out as well what i'd like to go for is an a/b/i setup so i have the option of run two amp simultan dure live perform i actual would even be interest in run three amp simultan if possibl though thi isn't absolut necessari if a three way splitter is insan expens compar to a two way a/b/i one i'm fine with stick to the two way one haul two amp to a show would probabl be enough work as it is i'v read how on album like siames dream multi tracking/lay guitar part wa a huge part of get that monstrou tone which got me think that if i rig up two or three amp to use all at onc while play live or while record i might be abl to sort of approxim that effect adam jone of tool use three amp with each one focus on handl a differ chunk of the frequenc rang or configur to creat a differ tonal gt so i ve alway play with two or three amp one for high end one that s good with midrang and one that kick in with the low or i use one that s got that good solid state metallica crunch and one that s got that warm marshal tube sound http //www guitarworld com/gw archive/dear guitar hero adam jone tool talk tone gear video band anonym time between album and more of cours in my case what i'm go for won't be anywher near the corgan esqu wall of sound deriv from stack 20 or 30 guitar track all at onc but have two amp go at onc is still a 100 increas in guitar it might also make record multipl guitar track easier and give me an interest way to get tonal varieti from record the same guitar part i could have two amp go at onc have them both mice up but have them configur differ so that while i'm play one guitar part two differ guitar tone would be gener and record and thi variat in tone could result from differ amp set or simpli by virtu of use say a solid state amp alongsid a tube amp question re splitter box and hum i have done some research and it seem that a splitter that elimin ground hum is vital http //www premierguitar com/articles/tone_stacking_with_two_amp http //www seymourduncan com/blog/th tone garage/multi amp rig 101 but i don't know anyth about thi kind of gadget i e what brand make them what price rang they usual fall in what featur to look for who make decent one that aren't crazi expens etc i'v never tri to rig up anyth thi complex are there ani a/b/i splitter box that are of decent/solid qualiti that effect elimin hum issu without be ultra expens it would be cool to run three amp at onc but if such a box is prohibit expens two amp is fine question re mice these amp dure live show and record also i wa wonder if you guy might have some input on way to mic these two amp dure live show and at home in my adam jone research i found thi inform from one of tool' engin say he would use two mic on each of jones' amp gt adam mainli run three amp he ha a marshal that he love a diezel and then he wa use a mesa boogi at one point i brought in a bogner uberschal head and a rivera knucklehead reverb and sever other thing then we just experi with combin of head and cabinet until it work for the song most of the 4 12 were mesa boogi cabinet which are superior for their low end except for the marshal head which went through a marshal cabinet and the rivera went through a rivera cabinet i usual use stock mike for me that' a shure sm57 and a sennheis 421 on everi cabinet the third mic could be anyth that i felt the sound need more of http //www guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jone tool guitar rig/ do you guy similarli recommend a combo mic setup of an sm57 and a sennheis 421 at the moment i just have one sm57 and three sm58 but at some point i might be open to get other mic what doe the 421 do that is differ from the sm57 would it make a differ in my sound while play live or just be too much unnecessari work for the sound guy question re captur three discret guitar track from three amp simultan in one take thi question might be too focus on record to be includ here so feel free to skip it i just thought i should includ it anyway sinc it is the last element i'd need to cover i have a veri basic behring xenyx 1204 4 channel mixer with a separ uca 200 rca to usb interfac that goe into my comput i'd be interest in be abl to captur separ track simultan by individu mice differ guitar amp while i play a singl take and run these mic cabl into separ channel on a mixer thi interview about adam jone' record techniqu explain what i mean gt the signal chain for track guitar wa a bit complex adam would play into whatev pedal he need barresi say that signal then went into a systemat system splitter then it would go to between three and five head the signal from the head went to their own individu cabinet each cabinet had two or three microphon on it then all the microphon came back to the consol and they were blend down as separ for each amp the diezel amp went to it own track the marshal amp went to it own track the third track wa a blend of the bogner and the rivera or whatev i like for the song and that would be one take three track of guitar http //www guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jone tool guitar rig/ in my case the problem is that when i run two or three or four mic into my mixer then out into the separ rca/usb interfac and into audac on my comput that everyth will just get mix down into one singl track is there ani way to have a mixer simultan record to multipl discret track on a comput program is the issu that my mixer doesn't have a usb output built in would i be abl to lay down multipl discret track all at onc with a differ mixer again no worri if peopl don't want to answer thi last question the other two more directli connect to livesound wherea thi is tie more to record sorri for the long post but thank in advanc you guy were incred help on my recent post ask about custom earplug for live perform so i realli valu your expertis,look to build an a/b/i multi guitar amp rig use stereo effect pedal for live perform and record but am concern about ground hum anyon have suggest for gizmo that can split a guitar signal without caus phase or hum problem question re mice thi multi amp rig live,long post sorry if this is a bit too guitar based of a question to be asked here but it doe concern my hope to set up a working multi amp rig for live performance without causing horrible sounding hum that would annoy an audience and a much a i love /r/guitar i feel like all of you brilliant folk here might have more understanding of the technical end of this issue i've noticed that various player with really big guitar sound like adam jones of tool have multi amp setup even guy like zakk wylde use a chorus pedal with multiple amp to thicken their sound at the moment i have a bos dd 6 delay with stereo out and i'm looking to add a bos chorus pedal and bos reverb pedal with stereo out a well what i'd like to go for is an a/b/y setup so i have the option of running two amp simultaneously during live performance i actually would even be interested in running three amp simultaneously if possible though this isn't absolutely necessary if a three way splitter is insanely expensive compared to a two way a/b/y one i'm fine with sticking to the two way one hauling two amp to a show would probably be enough work a it is i've read how on album like siamese dream multi tracking/layering guitar part wa a huge part of getting that monstrous tone which got me thinking that if i rigged up two or three amp to use all at once while playing live or while recording i might be able to sort of approximate that effect adam jones of tool us three amp with each one focused on handling a different chunk of the frequency range or configured to create a different tonality gt so i ve always played with two or three amp one for high end one that s good with midrange and one that kick in with the low or i use one that s got that good solid state metallica crunch and one that s got that warm marshall tube sound http //www guitarworld com/gw archive/dear guitar hero adam jones tool talk tone gear video band anonymity time between album and more of course in my case what i'm going for won't be anywhere near the corgan esque wall of sound derived from stacking 20 or 30 guitar track all at once but having two amp going at once is still a 100 increase in guitar it might also make recording multiple guitar track easier and give me an interesting way to get tonal variety from recording the same guitar part i could have two amp going at once have them both miced up but have them configured differently so that while i'm playing one guitar part two different guitar tone would be generated and recorded and this variation in tone could result from different amp setting or simply by virtue of using say a solid state amp alongside a tube amp question re splitter box and hum i have done some research and it seems that a splitter that eliminates ground hum is vital http //www premierguitar com/articles/tone_stacking_with_two_amps http //www seymourduncan com/blog/the tone garage/multi amp rig 101 but i don't know anything about this kind of gadget i e what brand make them what price range they usually fall in what feature to look for who make decent one that aren't crazy expensive etc i've never tried to rig up anything this complex are there any a/b/y splitter box that are of decent/solid quality that effectively eliminate hum issue without being ultra expensive it would be cool to run three amp at once but if such a box is prohibitively expensive two amp is fine question re micing these amp during live show and recording also i wa wondering if you guy might have some input on way to mic these two amp during live show and at home in my adam jones research i found this information from one of tool's engineer saying he would use two mics on each of jones' amp gt adam mainly run three amp he ha a marshall that he love a diezel and then he wa using a mesa boogie at one point i brought in a bogner uberschall head and a rivera knucklehead reverb and several other thing then we just experimented with combination of head and cabinet until it worked for the song most of the 4 12 were mesa boogie cabinet which are superior for their low end except for the marshall head which went through a marshall cabinet and the rivera went through a rivera cabinet i usually used stock miking for me that's a shure sm57 and a sennheiser 421 on every cabinet the third mic could be anything that i felt the sound needed more of http //www guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jones tool guitar rig/ do you guy similarly recommend a combo mic setup of an sm57 and a sennheiser 421 at the moment i just have one sm57 and three sm58s but at some point i might be open to getting other mics what doe the 421 do that is different from the sm57 would it make a difference in my sound while playing live or just be too much unnecessary work for the sound guy question re capturing three discrete guitar track from three amp simultaneously in one take this question might be too focused on recording to be included here so feel free to skip it i just thought i should include it anyways since it is the last element i'd need to cover i have a very basic behringer xenyx 1204 4 channel mixer with a separate uca 200 rca to usb interface that go into my computer i'd be interested in being able to capture separate track simultaneously by individually micing different guitar amp while i play a single take and running these mic cable into separate channel on a mixer this interview about adam jone's recording technique explains what i mean gt the signal chain for tracking guitar wa a bit complex adam would play into whatever pedal he needed barresi say that signal then went into a systematic system splitter then it would go to between three and five head the signal from the head went to their own individual cabinet each cabinet had two or three microphone on it then all the microphone came back to the console and they were blended down a separated for each amp the diezel amp went to it own track the marshall amp went to it own track the third track wa a blend of the bogner and the rivera or whatever i liked for the song and that would be one take three track of guitar http //www guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jones tool guitar rig/ in my case the problem is that when i run two or three or four mics into my mixer then out into the separate rca/usb interface and into audacity on my computer that everything will just get mixed down into one single track is there any way to have a mixer simultaneously record to multiple discrete track on a computer program is the issue that my mixer doesn't have a usb output built in would i be able to lay down multiple discrete track all at once with a different mixer again no worry if people don't want to answer this last question the other two more directly connect to livesound whereas this is tied more to recording sorry for the long post but thanks in advance you guy were incredibly helpful on my recent post asking about custom earplug for live performing so i really value your expertise,looking to build an a/b/y multi guitar amp rig using stereo effect pedal for live performance and recording but am concerned about ground hum anyone have suggestion for gizmo that can split a guitar signal without causing phase or hum problem question re micing this multi amp rig live,1

warn long post i'm hope to start a proper band project and start play bar gig but i'm veri concern about the potenti for hear loss i attend bar show on a weekli basi sometim twice a week but the one thing well apart from the tendenc to get pull into excess late night and too much drink that realli drive me nut is the loud of basic everi singl concert i attend there' absolut noth i can do about thi sinc everi guitarist want to blast their amp to 11 which i absolut understand as a guitarist myself ego is a hell of a drug but also becaus most of these bar space are pretti small and even without the live sound run through the speaker the sound in that enclos space is deafen what i'm wonder is if there are custom ear plug that can be purchas that might allow me to block out the more oppress sound level and frequenc to preserv my hear yet still allow me to hear enough of what i need to hear for enjoy of concert and monitor myself and my bandmat as a perform play on stage at these venu later thi year i have notic one of the long term musician in the scene wear what appear to be custom made ear plug that he ha around hi neck on a string that he wear at concert i can onli presum that they are built in such a way that he can still almost fulli enjoy the music at show and hear what he need to hear while protect hi hear doe anyon here have ani advic they could give me on such type of ear plug i imagin i might need to see an audiologist for these if they exist and they will cost in the 100 but i'm definit will to spend say 150 300 on someth like thi if can potenti preserv my hear and let me keep play and listen to music for the rest of my life question about custom ear plug and/or iem while perform my understand at the moment is that some sort of wireless iem system would be the way to go for protect my ear yet still be abl to hear what i need to hear while perform i do have a pair of shure se210 and se110 though it look like it would still cost anoth 1000 cad to get the whole wireless monitor system which i can't realli afford at the moment therefor i'm wonder if the sort of custom ear plug mention abov might allow me to protect my hear while play live yet still let enough sound through to adequ monitor thing though i get that thi might not be possibl sinc iem would actual allow sound to come through the earbud to let me hear thing wherea ear plug would just block out sound nevertheless it would be interest to see if there is some sort of middl ground between do noth and spend 1000 for a wireless iem system on that note sinc i alreadi do have a coupl set of shure iem is it at all possibl to build some kind of semi portabl wire monitor system that i could use on stage mayb involv use a littl cheap super basic behring type 1 or 2 channel mixer that i could have on stage with me and connect to the iem i know the main issu would be with tri to connect my mixer to the 'monitor sends' from the main mix board at the venu and of cours that might not be practic to run some 150 foot cabl from the sound guy' board all the way to the stage for me to use for monitor howev a at some local dedic music venu they do alreadi seem to have some kind of long cabl run a 'snake' link the stage to the soundboard where there are some 1/4 input jack avail for the guitarist to plug their guitar into that connect to the board b with these guitar input jack there are also long speaker wire run connect to some monitor speaker on the stage that perform use to hear themselv with thi kind of setup would it be theoret possibl to have the 1/4 inch speaker wire or mayb a super long 1/4 audio cabl run from the sound guy' booth that i could connect into a littl cheap mini mixer i have on stage next to me that i can plug my shure iem into so i can listen to both myself and the 'hous mix' of all the other instrument in my band while dial in my own monitor mix right there on stage also with thi kind of hypothet setup could i incorpor some kind of limit or compressor or nois reduc system that could protect my ear from ani sudden spike in volum come from the sound guy' board would a guitar nois reduc or compressor pedal work for that or would i need someth more special as bad as loud volum alreadi are at concert i can't imagin anyth wors for hear that a sudden surg in volum or feedback that run directli through my iem into my eardrum that' a terrifi prospect to consid there are musician friend i know who are incred talent yet quit a bit younger than me who have alreadi suffer consider hear loss meanwhil i know there are even some veteran sound guy who have suffer hear loss significantli which can't help with their job either i wa at 3 bar show in the last week alon and while i took break dure the first two for the last one i tough it out becaus i wa realli into the perform which is what i'v typic done up til now but i regret it alreadi as soon as i walk outsid midway through the last show my ear felt like they were complet clog and underwat and i had mild tinnitu for a good half hour after the pain i feel in my ear from the crank guitar and amp is almost immedi and i tri to sit further back from the stage though thi doesn't do much in small bar i also tri to take regular break becaus i can't stand the verit onslaught of sound i'll sometim feel a bit queasi over how loud thing are though then i feel bad for leav the show mid set becaus i don't want the band to think i'm not enjoy the perform i apolog for the length of the post and if i got ani of the technic terminolog wrong i'm not a train sound guy the most i did wa some veri basic work of a power mix while i wa run an open mic/jam night for a coupl of year though i did learn a lot in that time thank for ani input you guy and gal might offer,concern about potenti for hear loss as audienc member and perform at concert until i'm abl to afford a wireless iem system is it possibl to buy custom ear plug that block out or quiet the most harm frequencies/sound level while still allow for adequ listening/monitor,warning long post i'm hoping to start a proper band project and start playing bar gig but i'm very concerned about the potential for hearing loss i attend bar show on a weekly basis sometimes twice a week but the one thing well apart from the tendency to get pulled into excessively late night and too much drinking that really drive me nut is the loudness of basically every single concert i attend there's absolutely nothing i can do about this since every guitarist want to blast their amp to 11 which i absolutely understand a a guitarist myself ego is a hell of a drug but also because most of these bar space are pretty small and even without the live sound running through the speaker the sound in that enclosed space is deafening what i'm wondering is if there are custom ear plug that can be purchased that might allow me to block out the more oppressive sound level and frequency to preserve my hearing yet still allow me to hear enough of what i need to hear for enjoyment of concert and monitoring myself and my bandmates a a performer playing on stage at these venue later this year i have noticed one of the long term musician in the scene wearing what appear to be custom made ear plug that he ha around his neck on a string that he wear at concert i can only presume that they are built in such a way that he can still almost fully enjoy the music at show and hear what he need to hear while protecting his hearing doe anyone here have any advice they could give me on such type of ear plug i imagine i might need to see an audiologist for these if they exist and they will cost in the 100 but i'm definitely willing to spend say 150 300 on something like this if can potentially preserve my hearing and let me keep playing and listening to music for the rest of my life question about custom ear plug and/or iems while performing my understanding at the moment is that some sort of wireless iem system would be the way to go for protecting my ear yet still being able to hear what i need to hear while performing i do have a pair of shure se210s and se110s though it look like it would still cost another 1000 cad to get the whole wireless monitoring system which i can't really afford at the moment therefore i'm wondering if the sort of custom ear plug mentioned above might allow me to protect my hearing while playing live yet still let enough sound through to adequately monitor thing though i get that this might not be possible since iems would actually allow sound to come through the earbuds to let me hear thing whereas ear plug would just block out sound nevertheless it would be interesting to see if there is some sort of middle ground between doing nothing and spending 1000 for a wireless iem system on that note since i already do have a couple set of shure iems is it at all possible to build some kind of semi portable wired monitoring system that i could use on stage maybe involving using a little cheap super basic behringer type 1 or 2 channel mixer that i could have on stage with me and connect to the iems i know the main issue would be with trying to connect my mixer to the 'monitor sends' from the main mixing board at the venue and of course that might not be practical to run some 150 foot cable from the sound guy's board all the way to the stage for me to use for monitoring however a at some local dedicated music venue they do already seem to have some kind of long cable run a 'snake' linking the stage to the soundboard where there are some 1/4 input jack available for the guitarist to plug their guitar into that connect to the board b with these guitar input jack there are also long speaker wire run connecting to some monitor speaker on the stage that performer use to hear themselves with this kind of setup would it be theoretically possible to have the 1/4 inch speaker wire or maybe a super long 1/4 audio cable run from the sound guy's booth that i could connect into a little cheap mini mixer i have on stage next to me that i can plug my shure iems into so i can listen to both myself and the 'house mix' of all the other instrument in my band while dialing in my own monitor mix right there on stage also with this kind of hypothetical setup could i incorporate some kind of limiter or compressor or noise reducing system that could protect my ear from any sudden spike in volume coming from the sound guy's board would a guitar noise reducer or compressor pedal work for that or would i need something more specialized a bad a loud volume already are at concert i can't imagine anything worse for hearing that a sudden surge in volume or feedback that run directly through my iems into my eardrum that's a terrifying prospect to consider there are musician friend i know who are incredibly talented yet quite a bit younger than me who have already suffered considerable hearing loss meanwhile i know there are even some veteran sound guy who have suffered hearing loss significantly which can't help with their job either i wa at 3 bar show in the last week alone and while i took break during the first two for the last one i toughed it out because i wa really into the performer which is what i've typically done up til now but i regret it already a soon a i walked outside midway through the last show my ear felt like they were completely clogged and underwater and i had mild tinnitus for a good half hour after the pain i feel in my ear from the cranked guitar and amp is almost immediate and i try to sit further back from the stage though this doesn't do much in small bar i also try to take regular break because i can't stand the veritable onslaught of sound i'll sometimes feel a bit queasy over how loud thing are though then i feel bad for leaving the show mid set because i don't want the band to think i'm not enjoying the performance i apologize for the length of the post and if i got any of the technical terminology wrong i'm not a trained sound guy the most i did wa some very basic working of a powered mixed while i wa running an open mic/jam night for a couple of year though i did learn a lot in that time thanks for any input you guy and gal might offer,concerned about potential for hearing loss a audience member and performer at concert until i'm able to afford a wireless iem system is it possible to buy custom ear plug that block out or quiet the most harmful frequencies/sound level while still allowing for adequate listening/monitoring,1

can act as a stage box for my x32 consol elimin the need for the multicor snake then eventu i may add either two more iq10 or iq12 s see below i can also use ultranet to connect the speaker which cut down on cabl and simplifi everyth daisychain for the win i cannot seem to find ani tandem powercon/cat5 cabl so i guess i will have to make my own but that s not a big deal look at the spec of the iq10 s vs the iq12 s there isn t all that much differ i do sound reinforc mostli for acoust band and my current yamaha speaker have never fail to play loud enough the iq10 s play louder and lower than my current 12 speaker my current speaker are rate down to onli 60hz 10db and have a max spl of 125db while the iq10 s go to 55hz 3db with 129db max spl that is a signific differ do i even need to

that i won t need anymor i want to get some sub eventu and i wa look at activ option but then i rememb that i will have that p5000 that could easili power a pair of sub what is a good passiv sub i could get a pair of yamaha sw118v s for about 1000 which is the price of a singl turbosound iq18b i don t do that mani show where i would need sub are the yamaha sub decent or are there better passiv

main 4x turbosound iq10 monitor i m going to do this a piece at a time so my plan is to get a couple iq10 s and start using them a main for my weekly open mic gig and eventually get a couple more iq10 s for monitor and finally the x32 rack the x32 rack will give me more option for smaller gig the xr12 only ha 4 mic pre s and it can act a a stage box for my x32 console eliminating the need for the multicore snake then eventually i may add either two more iq10 or iq12 s see below i can also use ultranet to connect the speaker which cut down on cabling and simplifies everything daisychaining for

so i work both in livesound and in a studio and i'm current invest in my first set of microphon i borrow a few small diaphragm condens and personali a/b test them but all of my other assumpt are made base on a big bunch of youtub a/b comparison between mic so befor i buy i would like to hear if you would agre with what i heard pleas read my descript of the mic i'm interest in and just comment do you hear what i hear or you heard someth differ from these mic 1 condens overhead mic primarili so from a friend i got an offer to buy a stereo pair of se electron s1a microphon for an amaz price less then 100 dollar a pair i also borrow a sennheis e614 an akg c430 and an audio technica ath450 the ath is 200 euro each e614 anc c430 and 100 euro each and the s1a are obvious by far the cheapest my person test show that the e614 ha the flattest respons and the most natur sound it ha a slight midrang bump but i would pick it over the other for captur the entir kit or an instrument like an acoust guitar/violin the c430 wasn't veri natur there is a weird midrang bump didn't like it the ath wa a bit more open sound then the e614 less midrang more air but it cost twice as much and i don't think it' worth the differ the s1a have a slight boost abov 8k and are flat below 8k which to me seem like they are amaz as overhead mic sinc i get a great cymbal sound from them and i can add the midrang and definit from the closem consid the price of the use s1a' my plan wa to buy them instead of the other option i would later add anoth pair of more midrangi condend to the mic bag 2 kickdrum mic long stori short i don't like the rel flat respons of the mic like the akg d112 and the ev re 20 i know they are more natur but that' usual not what i'm look for with kickdrum sound and they make me eq a lot the beta 52 and the audix d6 for my tast are a one trick poni they both have an overli agress curv that can be great for metal but whenev i want anyth a bit more rock sound and more natur their boost and scoop are simpli too much and i can't fix that with an eq the sennheis e602 ii wa a winner for me here it also ha a pre eq curv that boost sub frequenc and the beater sound but it' more natur and not as agres plu there is no sharp 5k bump like with the beta 52 i can get the 2 3k smack from it that i can't get from a 52 becaus it onli give me the click and make the kickdrum sound a bit like a black metal trigger the newer e902 ha a flatter curv that i would like for a bass amp but not for a kickdrum so i wa go to but an e602 ii what do you think about what i heard 3 tom the md421 is to expens and not veri function for live use i like both the e604 and the e904 from the test i heard and from my experi but i'm not veri certain that the e904 can be call an overal better microphon it' just differ it clean up highmid compar to the e604 becaus it ha a more broad hi mid boost but it take away more of the below 100hz materi and make lower tune floortom sound empti in short i don't think the e904 is better i think it' differ and for tom it seem to me i would in mani case prefer the 604 to the 904 but i like the metal build of the e904 and sometim i can use the extra 5k click i get from the 904 snare and smaller tom i can't make a decis here need advic i would buy 3 tom mic 4 guitar 57 so 57 is a classic a huge hi mid boost that add definit to the guitar and that can sometim be great so i will have one in my bag beyer m201tg the complet contrast to the 57 which i still consid amaz for the guitar is the beyerdynam m201tg much flatter curv slight mid boost at 2 3k rich lowmid i love it i would use it when a want a warmer tone that' not go to be ear pierc and overli defin senn e906 the best balanc between the two so unlik the beyer which is quiet flat the 906 ha a midrang bump but at about 3 4k and it' a lot milder then the 57 so it add definit to the guitar but it doesn't cover up the around 2k midrang by boost 5 6k a thousand db like a 57 it seem to me to be the best option when the guitar amp sound amaz and i don't want to alter it' sound i would now buy the e906 and later a 57 the beyer it seem to me i can cover all base with there 3 veri differ microphon 5 vocal 58 let' take the 58 as a standard and compar to it sennheis e835 seem to be on pair with a 58 slightli differ curv better for some vocal wors for some other vocal sennheis e935 damn amaz more defin and natur mid then a 58 worth the 200 euro pricetag fantast overal balanc i wa plan on buy a e835 3 pack or some 58' cheap both seem good and buy one e945 for fanci concert sinc i wouldn't give it to a punk singer,advic on buy a new set of microphon my experi,so i work both in livesound and in a studio and i'm currently investing in my first set of microphone i borrowed a few small diaphragm condenser and personaly a/b tested them but all of my other assumption are made based on a big bunch of youtube a/b comparison between mics so before i buy i would like to hear if you would agree with what i heard please read my description of the mics i'm interested in and just comment do you hear what i hear or you heard something different from these mics 1 condenser overhead mics primarily so from a friend i got an offer to buy a stereo pair of se electronics s1a microphone for an amazing price le then 100 dollar a pair i also borrowed a sennheiser e614 an akg c430 and an audio technica ath450 the ath is 200 euro each e614 anc c430 and 100 euro each and the s1a are obviously by far the cheapest my personal testing showed that the e614 ha the flattest response and the most natural sound it ha a slight midrange bump but i would pick it over the others for capturing the entire kit or an instrument like an acoustic guitar/violin the c430 wasn't very natural there is a weird midrange bump didn't like it the ath wa a bit more open sounding then the e614 le midrange more air but it cost twice a much and i don't think it's worth the difference the s1a have a slight boost above 8k and are flat below 8k which to me seemed like they are amazing a overhead mics since i get a great cymbal sound from them and i can add the midrange and definition from the closemics considering the price of the used s1a's my plan wa to buy them instead of the other option i would later add another pair of more midrangy condenders to the mic bag 2 kickdrum mics long story short i don't like the relatively flat response of the mics like the akg d112 and the ev re 20 i know they are more natural but that's usually not what i'm looking for with kickdrum sound and they make me eq a lot the beta 52 and the audix d6 for my taste are a one trick pony they both have an overly agressive curve that can be great for metal but whenever i want anything a bit more rock sound and more natural their boost and scoop are simply too much and i can't fix that with an eq the sennheiser e602 ii wa a winner for me here it also ha a pre eq curve that boost sub frequency and the beater sound but it's more natural and not a agresive plus there is no sharp 5k bump like with the beta 52 i can get the 2 3k smack from it that i can't get from a 52 because it only give me the click and make the kickdrum sound a bit like a black metal trigger the newer e902 ha a flatter curve that i would like for a bass amp but not for a kickdrum so i wa going to but an e602 ii what do you think about what i heard 3 tom the md421 is to expensive and not very functional for live use i like both the e604 and the e904 from the test i heard and from my experience but i'm not very certain that the e904 can be called an overall better microphone it's just different it clean up highmids compared to the e604 because it ha a more broad hi mid boost but it take away more of the below 100hz material and make lower tuned floortoms sound empty in short i don't think the e904 is better i think it's different and for tom it seems to me i would in many case prefer the 604 to the 904 but i like the metal build of the e904 and sometimes i can use the extra 5k click i get from the 904 snare and smaller tom i can't make a decision here need advice i would buy 3 tom mics 4 guitar 57 so 57 is a classic a huge hi mid boost that add definition to the guitar and that can sometimes be great so i will have one in my bag beyer m201tg the complete contrast to the 57 which i still consider amazing for the guitar is the beyerdynamic m201tg much flatter curve slight mid boost at 2 3k rich lowmids i love it i would use it when a want a warmer tone that's not going to be ear piercing and overly defined senn e906 the best balance between the two so unlike the beyer which is quiet flat the 906 ha a midrange bump but at about 3 4k and it's a lot milder then the 57 so it add definition to the guitar but it doesn't cover up the around 2k midrange by boosting 5 6k a thousand db like a 57 it seems to me to be the best option when the guitar amp sound amazing and i don't want to alter it's sound i would now buy the e906 and later a 57 the beyer it seems to me i can cover all base with there 3 very different microphone 5 vocal 58 let's take the 58 a a standard and compare to it sennheiser e835 seems to be on pair with a 58 slightly different curve better for some vocal worse for some other vocal sennheiser e935 damn amazing more defined and natural mids then a 58 worth the 200 euro pricetag fantastic overall balance i wa planning on buying a e835 3 pack or some 58's cheap both seem good and buy one e945 for fancy concert since i wouldn't give it to a punk singer,advice on buying a new set of microphone my experience,1

hello r/livesound titl say it all i'm struggl to come up with the best way to do thi as there are current two school of thought on my team and i thought i'd get a third opinion thi saturday my colleg march band ha one of our choir join us on field for out halftim show and we realli aren't sure the best way to mic them they'll be stand in sever tight arc no more than 10 yard across one the front sidelin with a third of the band to their left and right and the last third mostli trumpet and the drumlin behind them my biggest concern is block the sound of the band and the drumlin from behind them my initi idea wa to put two or three small diagraph mic in front of them thi way we could use their bodi as a shield to absorb as much of the sound as possibl from behind them downsid is that we won't catch as mani peopl in the back the second idea is to use two boom hang over them point down but the closest thing my depart ha to a boom mic is the shure sm57 is that direct enough to not pick up sound come from the band behind and i guess the third idea a priori is some combin of both ani insight on thi thi is my first time mic' a choir and the challeng of find someth that work in a live set with a march band behind them is realli throw me off so ani insight would be appreci post game updat we had our rehears friday with the choir and our biggest issu wa feedback we initi had 4 57 out but cut it down to 2 after the feedback issu their final posit wa a littl below chest height point ever so slightli upward there were no problem when the band wa play quietli but as soon as they start to step on the ga we were hit major feedback veri quickli we pinpoint the feedback to surpris the drumlin and specif bass 3 wa tune to the same pitch that kept amplifi itself so we took that bass out of the show and eq'd out as much of the bass as possibl on our mixer overal everyth work there were onli a coupl moment dure the show feedback start to creep in but we kept it all under control look back i realli wish i had a drum shield will probabl make thi invest the next time we have a choir and an equal i'v been look at the behring fbq3102hd graphic equal anyway so we'll probabl add thi to our arsen soon thank you all for your help and suggest,mic' a choir on a footbal field with a 300 person march band behind them,hello r/livesound title say it all i'm struggling to come up with the best way to do this a there are currently two school of thought on my team and i thought i'd get a third opinion this saturday my college marching band ha one of our choir joining u on field for out halftime show and we really aren't sure the best way to mic them they'll be standing in several tight arc no more than 10 yard across one the front sideline with a third of the band to their left and right and the last third mostly trumpet and the drumline behind them my biggest concern is blocking the sound of the band and the drumline from behind them my initial idea wa to put two or three small diagraph mics in front of them this way we could use their body a a shield to absorb a much of the sound a possible from behind them downside is that we won't catch a many people in the back the second idea is to use two boom hanging over them pointed down but the closest thing my department ha to a boom mic is the shure sm57 is that directional enough to not pick up sound coming from the band behind and i guess the third idea a priori is some combination of both any insight on this this is my first time mic'ing a choir and the challenge of finding something that work in a live setting with a marching band behind them is really throwing me off so any insight would be appreciated post game update we had our rehearsal friday with the choir and our biggest issue wa feedback we initially had 4 57s out but cut it down to 2 after the feedback issue their final position wa a little below chest height pointed ever so slightly upwards there were no problem when the band wa playing quietly but a soon a they started to step on the gas we were hitting major feedback very quickly we pinpointed the feedback to surprise the drumline and specifically bass 3 wa tuned to the same pitch that kept amplifying itself so we took that bass out of the show and eq'd out a much of the bass a possible on our mixer overall everything worked there were only a couple moment during the show feedback started to creep in but we kept it all under control looking back i really wish i had a drum shield will probably make this investment the next time we have a choir and an equalizer i've been looking at the behringer fbq3102hd graphic equalizer anyways so we'll probably add this to our arsenal soon thank you all for your help and suggestion,mic'ing a choir on a football field with a 300 person marching band behind them,1
