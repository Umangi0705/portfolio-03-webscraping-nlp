Is a ThunderBolt audio interface worth it for a small home studio?,"Right now I record through a crappy AudioBox USB from many years ago and feels it’s time to upgrade.  

I play a Fender Strat and have a Moog mono synth, and Elektron’s Digitone, Digitakt, and Analog Four. This leaves me needing preferably 6 inputs, as I’ll probably route one Elektron into the other at a minimum. I’d also like a bit of room for expansion. So let’s say max even in a few years I’ll need 12 inputs even if I need a secondary preamp. Is ThunderBolt worth it or should I save some cash and just go for USB? I’m looking for an improvement in sound quality (better preamps) and also a reduction in noise, which could be completely my fault and not the AudioBox USB’s, I’ve still got a few things to try and get rid of the noise. 

My biggest pet peeve though is the latency between playback and input. So when I want to jam over something I recorded I have to put the mixer in the center and everything has a huge delay on it which is terrible for my productivity and the volumes are low overall hearing wise. The direct to DAW input is very enticing for me but I still do not know if it is worth the $1,000. Any help is appreciated. ",t2_24wuqxkk,31
What’s the difference b/w dithering and truncation?,"It’s my basic understanding that dithering is adding low, inaudible noises to cut off distortion and that it’s the final step to the mastering process while truncation is simply cutting off bit resolutions which in turn creates quantization errors. Am I right??",t2_y139dwj,9
Getting wide auto-panning to sound right/auto-panning tricks &amp; tips,"I’ve noticed that a lot of songs I really enjoy use a good bit of auto-panning (Dave Fridmann seems to really like using it).  The sounds tend to be shakers, tambourines, or higher-pitched dreamy sounding synths.

I tend to have a hard time making auto-panned sounds fit in the mix well. The element easily starts to seem too on top of the mix, one-dimensional and obnoxious.

I have tried widening the sound before and after auto-panning.  I’ve also tried using reverb after the auto-panning, but I still am not getting the sound I’m looking for in most cases.

Do you have any auto-panning tips or tricks? How do you get it to add movement and excitement in your mixes without sounding overbearing?",t2_4anq6,4
How do you separate multi-track's onto different desk channels?,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub or a really stupid question but;

Planning to buy some equipment and set up a home studio (not really a studio) to get a grips with the really in-depth mixing and EQ stuff; obviously without any live input this will rely on multi-tracks; I dont understand how it can go from the main file; to being patched onto different desk channels; surely the desk still sees it as ONE input as it will just be a signal from a laptop?? is it software that can separate it up so the desk sees it as different inputs? 

&amp;#x200B;

Again sorry if it's a very obvious question; We are mainly based around live sound and don't really do much software/pre-recorded work.

Thanks in advance",t2_ls0mu,2
Static hiss coming from laptop when using headphones,"I have a laptop that I can hear noise from when there should be silence. I can deal with it when listening to music or watching videos, but it's kind of annoying when producing or mixing. I have an interface that I can plug in and that solves it, but I don't like to carry it around all the time. I was wondering if a usb headphone amp (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Fiio-Portable-Headphone-Amplifier-DAC/dp/B0189EVGAG/ref=mp_s_a_1_16?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545252662&amp;sr=8-16&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&amp;keywords=fiio+headphone+amp)) would likely solve the issue. The noise is not always there, but any time I have a video/audio application running it will be there even if it's not in play mode. The second I close those programs it's gone.",t2_ycnkbgu,2
Suggestions for Isolating Small Studio Room on a Budget?,"Hi all,

Opened up my new mixing room here in Brooklyn and I'm trying to figure out the cheapest, most efficient way to isolate the noise in my room and prevent it from hitting my neighbors. I'm in a multi-faceted studio building with many tenants, and I have 2 neighbors on either side of me. Turns out the walls do not have any insulation installed between them; only 2 panels of sheetrock against studs. 

My room is 115 SF. It's small, but it's enough for what I do. So, I don't really have the space to build a room-within-room setup. I've already been lectured about how having more mass will be the best solution, but I just don't have that kind of space. I'm looking for a solution that will at least dampen my output to the neighbors.

P.S. I considered posting to r/acoustics but their community is a lot smaller than this one, so I figured I'd give it a shot here!",t2_66xu4,2
Confusion about automation in general,"Hey guys,

I feel like a lot of famous audio engineering say that good automation is going to make the biggest difference between an amateur mix and a professional one. I can see why people say this, but I'm still not sure what exactly I'm supposed to be automating. What am I supposed to be trying to achieve with automation?

Gold Star Studios Chambers (isolated Ronettes recording),"I'm a fanatic for that old Gold Star/Phil Spector sound, and I just heard this for the first time.  The claps at the beginning and Ronnie's opening ""Woah-oh""s might be the cleanest isolated example of the sound and long decay of the chambers at Gold Star.  (The tails overlap, but it sounds like it might be at least a good 3 seconds.)

(Edit: I got a rough estimate from one of the long claps and counting/converting the BPM, and it's around 3.1 seconds, at least on a cell phone speaker)

Question about level clipping while mixing drums?,"Tried this in another sub but got no response, please let me know if this is more appropriate in another sub:

Firstly, it it's worth mentioning, I'm using reaper on Windows 10.

Wondering if anyone else has this issue while mixing, specifically with drums. First off, I make sure I record my levels peaking ~  -6db. I take time to make sure my source is the best it can be before it goes into the DAW. When I'm mixing, I watch my levels and main fader to make sure I'm not peaking above -12db, and yet...my drums can't stop clipping!

The only effects I'm adding on my 4 tracks are EQ, light compression and light reverb. I don't hear clipping, they sound good, but I have to either turn down my main fader like 15-25% to avoid seeing the levels clip or turn down the individual faders a lot.

The other problem I have is when I do have a good drum sound, when I slowly begin to ease my other instruments in, the drums become buried in the mix and it makes it feel like all the processing I did is never heard. If I do hear the drums, I have to keep my instruments down, but then that makes the mix sound sort of lop sided and weak.

I also use high pass filters on my guitars/vocals and generally try to remove any unnecessary frequencies, but I'm still learning at using a fully parametric (visual) EQ effectively.

Appreciate any suggestions or input. Thanks!",t2_4o9pk38,1
DIY dsp like soundgrid?,"The idea of having a dedicated server to handle my plug ins seems really great, but soundgrid is a commitment that I’m not ready to make. I’m curious if it’s possible to run a rig similar to this, where my plug ins can be processed on another device that’s linked to my host computer via Ethernet? I’m sure it’s a long shot, but if it’s possible I’m down for the challenge. ",t2_1cm6qvc1,1
Avantone CV-12 x Kaotica Eyeball,"Hey guys,

Some questions before I start mixing my band's somewhat dense post-rock-ish EP," I'm about to start mixing my new band\\'s new music and thought I\\'d spew some questions to hopefully guide me well. I've always mixed my bands, and always thought they turned out pretty decent, but could be better.

Any general tips on semi-dense music, containing sections with 3 reverb/delay-laden guitars, all double-mic\\'d (an sm57 and a fathead)...sometimes a more rhythmic part along with a lead, sometimes just 2 or 3 riffy/arpeggio'd parts, sometimes two rhythmic parts with kind of alternating high notes so the rhythm(s) contain the leads. Basically tips on parsing things like that and placing them well and all that.

More specific questions:

* I see often people saying to mix in mono to place everything in the right spot, frequency-wise. That makes sense, but I feel like multiple guitar parts REQUIRE panning. I mean you don\\'t (often) cut frequencies in one guitar to make room for another, do you? Or do you? And either way, is mixing in mono to start with a universally agreed upon method or are there downsides? Should I do it with all the non-guitar instruments, and carve out a spot for ALL the guitars to live, then pan to get the guitars sounding good? I've never tried starting in mono.
* We\\'re using programmed drums with superior drummer. I think I've got them sounding PRETTY natural by sending them all to the same reverb, and with superior drummer\\'s humanizing stuff, but any other tips for making unreal drums sound real (other than the programming itself)?
* I feel like in more emotional, less...steady and \\""rocking\\"" music, the kick should be more felt than heard. Is this a common belief? Whenever I can hear the click really clearly in post-rock music, it feels weird. Am I alone in that? Any tips for mixing kick?
* If you were to approach mixing a band like Explosions in the Sky but with vocals, what would you do with the vocals to still make them clear while also not detracting too much from the music. I've seen bands go to both extremes...like Appleseed Cast had an album where the vocals were heavily effected. And Foxing had an album where the vocals were up front and clear. Maybe somewhere in between? What do you think? My bands have always suffered from being \\""music for musicians\\"" and I\\'m trying to change that with this one by making it a little more accessible in the mix. To me that means clearer and more up front vocals, but I do want the musical subtleties and stuff to come through, since that really is our focus.

I don\\'t know if this breaks rule 4, hopefully not since I asked a lot of specific questions, but here\\'s a rough mix of one of our songs to give an idea of our style. Any general thoughts on what you\\'d do different would be great. I have plenty of issues with this mix...sibilance, drums, and just a bunch of tweaks I\\'d make, but would love to hear your thoughts...as I think a lot of mixing advice is geared towards making like...ROCK music and I don\\'t feel like that\\'s really what we are.

Missing 10k+ in my mix?,"I was comparing a mix of mine to a commercial release by LUFS-matching the two tracks and then comparing key frequency bands. I found that all frequency bands were within +/- 2db of the commercial release except for the 10k+ range which was much quieter in my mix than in the commercial release.

Are there any very common reasons for this to occur?

&amp;#x200B;

My best guesses are: 

1. The commercial release had somewhat more electronic instrumentation. Would the overtones of these instruments reach higher than other non-electronic instruments?
2. The commercial release was a lossy format while my mix was a .wav file. Could the lossy format add information (distortion?) in the 10k+ range?
3. Are commercial mixes often given a big 10k+ EQ boost on the mix bus? 
4. With regards to frequencies greater than 10kHz, am I just generally stupid and deficient?",t2_tivuq,23

How much soundproofing do you actually need for vocals?,"I've been looking at options for soundproofing, creating a small booth, putting huge blankets all over the place... But it all seems a bit overkill for what i actually need it for. It's only for vocals, i live in a terrace house and the walls are kinda thin so it makes me really self-conscious about singing loud so it limits my range.  I've even thought about making a small soundproof box to put over my head, as ridiculous as it sounds, at least it would get the job done and it would probably be cheap to make though i'm sure there would be issues with comb filtering and airflow i bet. So how much soundproofing do you even need for a voice to stop it travelling through the walls?",t2_y5976,12
Possibly the dumbest question ever posted here but... How do you get a reference track?,"Okay so before you laugh to hard, all of the music I have is either streaming or from iTunes. 

Streaming obviously comes across in low quality and I cant set it in my project. Purchase from iTunes do not give you 24bit wave files, which honestly I do not know if that is necessary or not? I could pull a song off youtube, but again, low quality.

So where do I get reference tracks, and what quality / file format is necessary for it to be a good reference? ",t2_tx88ztq,68
Question About Phase,"I understand the importance of making sure mics are in-phase during both recording and mixing, but when working ITB is there any reason you can't just zoom in on the waveforms and line up peaks with peaks/troughs with troughs visually? I see a lot of dudes using plugins like Sound Radix Auto-Align for lining up polarity but it seems like an unnecessary gadget when you can just get different sources in phase by referencing sharp transient across several tracks, i.e. a rimshot on the snare. I did this on a project recently and really beefed up a snare in a way that simply flipping the polarity couldn't accomplish. Any input or just general phase discussion much appreciated :-)",t2_63z3k,3

Old Firewire equipment to Thunderbolt,"Hey All, I have an old Presonus Firestudio project devices that outputs with  IEEE 1394. I cannot figure out a way to adapt it to USBc Thunderbolt or usb3.

I might just have to get new equipment but it stinks because the old equipment worked great and suited my purposes. Thanks for any insight! ",t2_207be601,9
Waves Free Mixing Course with Dave Darlington / reference track question,"Just found this sub today, and I’m glad, because I really want to become the best audio producer/mixer guy I possibly can.  I’ve been self producing/mixing a record for 9 months (ive done several records in the past ten years but this is the most seriously I’ve ever taken it). I am of course also the artist and the writer and blah blah, we are in the age of many hats. 

Wondering if anyone has watched this Waves series? I’ve found it extremely useful. Not always gonna have all the plugins mentioned but just watching pros go at it and talk about their process and why they make their choices is really cool. I’m not done watching them really but one questions that really stands out to me is this: 


When using a reference track, wouldn’t that track already be mastered? How is it helpful to reference a fully mastered track with a track that’s in the mix phase? Like it feels like using a mainstream released track for reference when mastering makes sense, but how are we supposed to get hold of the mixes?? 

",t2_16drc7,9
Power adapter question for audio interface,"I just bought an old used Scarlett 18i6, and it didn’t include the power adapter. I plugged in a 12V adapter rated for 350mA, and all I saw in the mixcontrol software was a full meter of static on every analog channel. It’s asking for 12V 1A, so I assume that the static was a result of under powering the device. 

My local Best Buy sells an AC-DC adapter, variable voltage (up to 12V) and rated for 1.3A. Will this power adapter work for my interface? I assume that even though it’s rated for 1.3A, the interface will only draw as much current as it needs. 

Is there a flaw in my logic here? Also, do you think I’m correct in my theory that the static on every channel is due to under powering the interface? The seller said that it was fully functional, and he had a number of good reviews. 
Thanks!


UPDATE: 12V 1A power supply worked great, thankfully it looks like under-powering via current didn't do any damage. I ended up grabbing the variable voltage power supply just for the sake of having a spare around, and am planning to order one specifically for the 18i6.",t2_1pgy101t,3

Audio interface routing software,"Is there a universal type of software that makes it easy to route things to and from the ins/outs of an interface? 

I have a Behringer interface (UMC204) that works fine but it doesn’t seem to have any support for software like I see people using with focusrite and other brands. 

I’m considering getting a bigger interface but I want to get one that is able to configure inputs and out puts the way I want.

How do you personally use track sends in a DAW? Are the typical dual send knobs per track in DAWs an obsolete artifact from analog days? Or am I missing out by not using them?,"I don't use them. When I want reverb on a track I add it to that track and tailor it for that track. Same with any other audio effect. I get how they are essential on analog when I have only limited hardware, but a software effect can be multiplied almost indefinitely so we don't need to share one effect configuration between multiple tracks.

So is the way they are incorporated into DAWs vestigial? Or is there still importance behind shared effects over individual? Is there a way I could be effectually using the sends? Can having the same effect on multiple tracks somehow pull a song together in some way? Or is it simply just for the convenience of ""well, I always set my [whatever effect] the same no matter what so might as well just do it once""?

LOUD but not crushing transients?,"hey everyone. been producing electronic music for 4 years now. ive read a lot on trying to get a loud master. ive picked up a few things such as a loud master depends on a really good mixdown etc. while all this is good i still am not able to get the loudness i would like. i listen to some of these guys tracks and am blown away at how loud they can push their tracks without clipping their drum transients and squashing the absolute life out of their tracks. i guess my biggest question is........how do i get my master loud but to where the drums are still clear and aren't crushed to death? ill post some tracks below for reference. im sorry i know this question has been answered probably a thousand times i just can't find anything that has REALLY stuck with me over the years. appreciate any replies!

Now: In the end we all want to work with the best stuff available out there. Problem will always be: budget. If my school had unlimited money we would be working with GrandMA's and stuff, but they don't.

Cut EQ -&gt; Compression -&gt;Boost EQ ?,"I've been getting into the technique of cutting the frequencies you dont want before you compress ... and then boost after compression.

Let's say you're working on a Snare drum. 

Cut EQ: You high pass around 100 hz and cut 500 Hz at 3 db.

You now throw in your compressor... set your attack, release, etc.

BOOST EQ: Now in comes your 2nd EQ for boosting. Boost 180 Hz and 2500 Hz.

My question is: if your 2nd EQ is meant for boosting... and the ""cutting"" portion was done by the first eq (before compression) ... won't all the cutting be reintroduced since those frequencies were left alone in that 2nd EQ?

It seems to me, that EQ, compression, reverb and effects are just tools to make that balance shine even more. You want to use those things to bring out the character of the parts and remove clutter.

Is this how you view the balance stage? At what point do you check your mixes against others? While balancing? or when you're closer to being done?

Monitoring Problems,"I am mixing using Yamaha HS7s.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm having is that I get the mix sounding good in the monitoring environment, but when I take the mix to my hi-fi, it is far too bass heavy. I have to work on the mix, and then reference on the hi-fi, only to find that there are still too many bassy undertones.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mixing a jazz quartet, and the problem is the upright bass. It was recorded with both a bridge mic and a DI. Both have 50hz high pass filters on them, and are peaking at about -18 on the faders, but it still sounds too much through hi-fi and even my pc speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I go down to 44.1 when I’ve been doing 88.2 or 96?,"In another thread on here I was completely surprised to see that the consensus was that tracking at 44.1k was the norm. At the studio I’ve been recording at, they’d never be caught dead tracking at anything below 96k. I often do 88.2. And always 24 bit depth. My projects eat up space fast, and it would be nice to have smaller file sizes. Also my computer can handle it better when the projects aren’t so data heavy. 

Can 44.1k sound great then? I’ve been lectured by my producer many times about why 96k is the best. And how like plugins, mixing, mastering want better data I guess, and then you shrink it down for the consumer. Kind of like shooting in 4K but releasing a video in HD.

Having issues with a producer,"tl;dr Our producer's not what I expected and there's tension in the band/studio that may necessitate change.


Two years ago my band started production of our first full-length album with a guy who was just putting his foot in the door with owning his own studio. He didn't have the capability to record live drums and didn't have the confidence to record live bass, and so programmed both. He didn't think our lead guitarist picked hard enough, and re-did his rhythm parts (wrong, in a few spots) on his own rather than work it out with the guy who wrote them. He's seen us live a few times and knows what *we* sound like as a band, but that sound didn't make it through production.

Well, we finally got around to starting on the next album about two months ago and the rest of the band agreed to keep working with the same guy. By now he's in a new building, has a good drum room, and feels confident enough to work with low end. But I'm not sure we're well off. 

Most bands in our genre program drums. We have one hell of a good drummer who's  actually played on only one or two tracks in the past 10(?) years he's been in the scene, maybe more, and has almost nothing to show for his efforts. I'm not convinced the rest of the guys see the *need* to have him on the record and it's clear as day our producer's too saturated in our scene culture push anything. 

On the first day of recording, he apparently told our new rhythm guitarist that he's too good to re-record. So he's probably still not interested in recording *us* like we're paying him to. 

Then comes day three. As we're working out some song structures I look over his screen and see he's recording at 44.1khz. Now, I trust my own ears and the relief of peace of mind over any science and wouldn't dare track anything under 24/48, and mention this to him. He refutes with something about how 48khz takes up too much space/processing power or what not, nothing close to a realistic excuse to me, but I thought we wound up having a civil discussion about it all. He came across as calm and collected, maybe a little proud or amused, but everyone else in the room got a bit alarmed, telling me not to pick fights with the producer, and I remember being taken out to the balcony for a cig and to ""cool down"" or whatever they thought I needed. 

I came out of it thinking ""If this is how we butt heads, we're gonna get along great"". Again, it was a civil conversation. I don't know *what* everyone else could have possibly heard to think otherwise. 

But maybe I shouldn't have been so optimistic: he's apparently been open with others in the band about how whatever I said ""pissed him off"". They're all convinced. I don't know where I stand in his eyes, but with the lack of communication here plus everything that went wrong with the last album I *reeallly* do not want to continue with him. 

The last time I recorded with other people was basically just two or three noobs yelling and poking fun at each other until we got a good mix. *That* somehow worked. *This* is making me fucking nervous. 

Right now I'm half afraid to give input for my own album. Maybe it's my anxiety, but something about the guys' dispositions isn't giving me warm fuzzies about our upcoming sessions. ",t2_wobc5,109

"Drum Kit Saturation – By track, whole kit, or both?","Yes I know that ***""it depends""***. I'm looking for a rule-of-thumb.

How should saturation be approached for multi-track percussion? Yes the kick will likely be saturated, but then you go ""hey, saturation sounds good on the hi-hat too,"" etcetera, because saturation makes everything sound better and that can't be the proper way to decide to use it or not.

So if you're saturating many tracks of a drumkit individually, would it not be better to saturate the bus for the entire kit instead? Or is the thinking that each track will generally need a different amount of compression? Is stacking by-track saturation with ""global"" saturation feasible or overkill?",t2_rfo73,5

"Audio ends up sounding quiet and slightly lacking in ""presence""; anything I can do?","So, I do gaming videos on YouTube, and something I've been trying to figure out is my audio. I've never been great at understanding audio, and how to make it sound good. Now, my audio is actually fine, technically. Or, rather, it's not bad. I'm just a bit nitpicky, and I'm trying to see if there's any tweaks I can make to make it sound better.

I'm not even really sure how to describe what bugs me about my audio. The best way I can put it is, when I watch a video or stream of someone else, their audio sounds as though they're right there in the room with me, yet when I watch my own videos back, it sounds like I'm ""watching a video"". Does that make sense? It's not bad, but it's just slightly... off. It also sounds a touch quieter than a typical ""pro"" YT video, which I don't understand.

My process for recording and processing my audio is as follows:

​

- I record in OBS, with the commentary audio on a separate track. I use OBS filters for noise suppression and noise gate, and I also use a compressor filter with the following settings:

Ratio (X:1): 3

Threshold (dB): -30

Attack (ms): 1

Release(ms): 60

- I import the audio into Audacity, and use Equalization to boost the bass and treble, I use the hard limiter to even out the audio a bit, then normalize to -1, and use noise removal to clean up any extra background noise/ frequencies. I export the audio as a WAV file (with whatever the default settings Audacity uses for that).

- I edit my videos in Premiere (Elements), and when I export them out to a final video, it uses 320kbps AAC audio. The audio format options are either AAC, Dolby Digital, or MPEG.

​
I record in a small room, and while I don't have any kind of noise proof padding, I've seen other channels that record in a similar type of room that still sound better than mine.

Is there anything in there that could be tweaked to help me out? I really don't know what to tweak or how to tweak it.

Someone suggested I ditch the noise suppressor in OBS, and I tried that, but I don't hear any noticeable difference, other than a more noticeable ""hissing"" frequency.

I was wondering if perhaps the compressor is what's causing my issue, but I also like the idea of a compressor (as, to my understanding, it helps to keep the audio relatively consistent throughout, which is nice, because I sometimes get really quiet and really loud at random intervals). Do bigger YTers/ streamers not use compressors? Is that not actually a thing?

Again, I realize it's not a big deal like I'm making it sound. If there's nothing I can do, it is what it is, and again, my audio isn't exactly bad. I just find myself extremely curious about how to improve my quality.",t2_8mirrdj,1

Stereo/Mono/Phase invert and for mixing &amp; mastering for vinyl,"I am very much a beginner at mixing and mastering, but I am working on masters for vinyl (for want of money, not lack of faith in professional engineers) and am trying to reduce stereo low end on a mix. I think I am doing okay because when I test the mix in mono mode, the low end of bass and drums doesn't move at all, just seems like some of the high end on synths and shakers etc are spread out a bit more in stereo vs mono. When I do phase invert on either L or R, not much changes. When I do a mono   + phase invert on either channel, the low end and bass and drums mostly disappears, which I'm taking to mean that if you isolate far L or R, there's only high end information there, which would be good for vinyl because you don't wan't low frequencies on the wide ends of the stereo field or it will cause skips. Am I right about this, or should you be able to still hear low end in that phase invert + mono monitoring? Thanks in advance for anybody that takes time to answer this.

EDIT: Thanks all so much for your advice, so helpful. Also I should clarify to address some other concerns that were raised: I am in contact with the cutting engineer, and I'm at this stage because my first set of masters had too much stereo bass information, so I'll get feedback on the next pass.

Question regarding conflicting guidelines in ACX submission guidelines regarding sound levels.,"I'm looking to start recording audiobooks for my novels. I'm intending to use the ACX platform (Audible), but a couple of their submission guidelines have me a little perplexed.

One guideline reads as follows:

&gt;**Each file must measure between -23dB and -18dB RMS.**

&gt;Put simply, all files must fall within a specific volume range. By keeping all files within this range - not too loud and not too soft - listeners won't have to constantly adjust the volume of their playback device.

But the next guideline reads:

&gt;**Each file must have peak values no higher than -3dB.**

&gt;By leaving this headroom you'll reduce the possibility of distortion, which can reduce the quality of the listening experience. This headroom is also needed to ensure files are successfully encoded. 

These two seem contradictory to me, as the first one seems to say that there can't be any sound higher than -18dB, but the second suggests that there can be sound up to -3dB.

I'm very new to audio recording, so perhaps that's why I'm confused, but if anybody can point out something I'm missing, I would be greatly appreciative.

The importance of a consistent workflow (or presets work too I guess),"I'm in the mildly agonizing process of mixing my next release, and ran into a major facepalm moment today. One song has been irritating me for weeks because it was coming off extremely muddy and I had no idea why. It's an instrumental tune and I DI everything so there's no way it was room noise or anything. I messed with EQ on every instrument at least 10 times and couldn't get it to sit right. I gave up and decided to come back later (always good advice).

&amp;#x200B;

Another song was coming across way too sterile and didn't have enough punch. I had the brilliant realization that I probably needed to adjust the high pass on the reverb. I decided to cross-reference the reverb's high pass on the other songs to try to unify them a bit more. I go back to the instrumental track to check on the reverb and...never did it. That would certainly explain the mud.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say I now have a preset on both my EQ plugin and reverb so that doesn't happen again. Literally hours of agony because I'm a total idiot.

Anyone else using Auto-Tune Pro or other Antares software?,"I’ve always been a huge fan of Antares software because also being heavily interested in computers, I’ve always been fascinated by the algorithms that must work behind their plugins, especially Auto-Tune. I also found a bug one time in one of the minor releases of Auto-Tune 7 and emailed them about it, and one of the developers actually called me to talk about it while I helped him reproduce it on his machine so they could fix it in the next release. That was really cool being a programmer, and being a teenager at the time knowing that I was the reason a bug in a piece of software used in thousands of major studios around the world got fixed with the next update, haha. 

Anyways, I’ve been using Auto-Tune since I purchased the boxed version of Auto-Tune Evo several years ago and I’ve purchased every single update since. So as soon as Auto-Tune Pro came out I bought the update, and I’ve been using it for several months. I really like the new UI design and I think it was a well-needed refresh.

However, when it comes to actually working with it, I’m really disappointed. It’s buggy as hell. 

First off, when they first released version 9.0.0, there was a bug where the update window would pop up *every single time* you’d open up the plugin telling you that an update was available to version 9.0.0, even though that was the version you were running. Antares quickly pushed out 9.0.1 within a matter of days, a release specifically to address this bug. But what concerns me is exactly how did the developers manage to miss that? How do you miss a bug that obvious that occurs *every single time* the plugin is opened?

Secondly, it’s super unstable. It seems to be better in automatic mode, but in graphical mode it randomly crashes Logic Pro quite frequently (like every 5 minutes). I thought maybe it was an issue with Logic, so I tried it in Reaper instead, and same thing.

Lastly, there are just random minor bugs throughout. For example, in graphical mode, the adjust vibrato knob literally does nothing on line objects. I thought maybe this was just missing functionality for line objects, but according to the manual, it should. Sometimes the cursor in graphical mode also randomly jumps while you’re drawing an object, which is really annoying.

I don’t know, I feel like Antares has really dropped the ball with this one, and I’m kind of disappointed, especially since I’ve been a loyal customer of their’s for years. It almost seems like Auto-Tune Pro was hyped up by Antares at all these producer and audio engineering conferences, just to be rushed to release long before it had gone through proper testing for bugs and stability. I think I’m going to switch back to 8.1 for now until they release the next patch because sonically the two releases are supposedly the same, but who knows when the next patch for Auto-Tune Pro will be. We’ve already been stuck with version 9.0.1 for about half a year, when I’m sure I can’t be the only one that has noticed these bugs.

Will I EVER understand compression...?,"Ahh yes, my monthly compression post...

I 'get' the idea of compression but I am struggling SO much with how to hear what is reasonable/appropriate/too much when adding compression. Here's my understanding and PLEASE correct me on any or all of this:

Threshold: The point where the plug in actually kicks in.

Ratio: How much of the sound over the threshold is compressed.

Attack: Length of time before Compression kicks in

Release: How long compression is held for

Makeup Gain: Getting the 'lost' volume back from the compression.

Please help me with my effect,"Im using a zoom g5 with my saxophone so i connect it with the XLR output. On the side of the output there are 2 buttons called pre/post switch and ground switch.

PRE/POST switch
Use this switch to set the point when the signal is output from the BALANCED OUT connector.
Set it to “POST” (pushed in) to output the signal after the effects. Set it to “PRE” (not pushed in) to output the signal before the effects.

GROUND switch

Mixes lacking energy and punch,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been recording and mixing for a few years now and I feel as though I have a grasp on the fundamentals. I mainly work on rap and R&amp;B but do the odd rock record here and there. Lately I’ve been comparing my mixes with industry ones, and the one thing I’ve noticed is a considerable difference in loudness, energy and punch. A couple of things I do notice on big records these days is that the vocals are loud as hell and in your face, the 808 or synth bass and kick are the second loudest, and the snare or clap is tucked neatly right behind the lead vocal. (Couple tracks I’m referencing are No Stylist by French Montana and Kika by Tory Lanez) 

I’ve tried so many techniques, parallel compression, rear buss compression, M/S EQ, saturation, soft clipping on drums, etc. No matter what I do I find I still can’t get that “sound” that I hear in those records. 

The last thing is that I’m scared to death of making my tracks too loud for Spotify as it just turns them way down, as I’ve received some nasty emails from clients in the past about this.

Cost of Rehearsal Studio Buildout,"Hey everyone, hoping for some direction here...

I am in the process of buying the business assets of a rehearsal studio building. However, the building itself will not be around much longer, and we need to find a new place to go. I have probably 4 months before the owners of the new building would start swinging a hammer, unless I can convince them otherwise.

In the past week my head has been spinning doing my own research on the cost of construction for these types of studios and what is truly required. It’s been all over the map, literally from $25/sf to $250/sf. I’ve also been told that a new construction on land is financially off the table, compared to finding something that already exists and doing a buildout.

The current studio has more than 20 units. Most of which are 180 sf trapezoidal practice rooms, with a couple higher grade areas of 800-1000 sf with light racks and leprecon controllers for larger acts and hourly rental.

There’s not a single right angle anywhere. All areas between the halls and units are double dry walled (air in between, not insulation), two sets of regular old doors, and the ceiling was hung suspended independently of each unit, with tiles to capture noise. As for the floor... it’s concrete and there is some travel between units; they compensated by cutting grooves into the foundation and placing wedges (I’m sure that’s not the technical term) between units in the areas between the double drywall.

The largest speakers in the building are Meyer CQ1’s and a lot of 4x12s, with quite a few ISP 500 watt wedge monitors on stage. Buttkickers are used pretty frequently by larger acts that come in, and in my experience do travel between the units. Those are in the  larger spaces by the way... the smaller 180 sf spaces have minimal equipment, or the musicians will bring their own (usually non-stack) amps. Foam wall pads are sparsely scattered throughout and all look second-hand / salvaged.

This is by far the best constructed “non professional” rehearsal space I’ve used, the way. My first space I rented 20 years ago was in an abandoned leather building, and the other space I had rented out was an old elementary school. Both of them basically just lined the walls with carpet and called it a day. 

Now, if we do lose the building and I’m forced to start anew, I have a lot of questions in order to maximize my investment. I’m not sure each of the practice rooms need the Cadillac treatment, but I don’t want my tenants surrounded by rotting carpet either. So I’m open to opinions on where to shoot for, quality wise. Other than that...

A) what should I be looking for in a building? An empty shell? An office to retrofit? I’m assuming single floor. How about height?

B) Construction labor rates are quite high at this time thanks to the booming economy, and the last thing i want is to end up with double costs in twice the timeframe. Are there any tips here on managing this? Are there pre-fab materials I can use to get a better handle on exact costing? Or would that be astronomical in comparison? In a perfect world I would want to be able to accurately cost the 180 sf practice pods, and then get creative with the larger spaces to accommodate to the crowd that would be willing to pay more daily/monthly.

C) are there specific “gurus” in this industry that cater to these types of buildings? In the past couple weeks I have gotten a lot of head scratching from financiers, contractors, and architects who can’t quite wrap their heads around the concept of these spaces. It would be great to find a resource to help me get right to the point.

D) Am I completely crazy? Any sage words of advice from someone who’s ever been in a similar situation?

I really appreciate the help here. It would be the achievement of a lifetime to save this space. I just now wish I had a few years of construction management under my belt...

Thanks all, you’re helping someone fulfill a dream here.

The most insane/bizarre source of random noise I've ever come across....,"&amp;#x200B;

So and my brother DJ, quite a complex setup - two laptops, two controllers, synced via an Ethernet cable, audio from both laptops into a tiny little 2-channel mixer, which then goes into monitor speakers.

For a while things were pretty crappy, so we just put up with the random noise from the big monitor wedge we use. It's pretty crap, but it's fine for rehearsing and when we play live we use the club's PA system, so we'd rather spend our money elsewhere.

Yet today I introduced a new laptop to the setup, and the noise was insane - really loud, really weird, it sounded like someone had placed a tiny microphone in the CPU and amplified the volume 10000 times.

I narrowed it down to everything - it wasn't the new cables, wasn't the controller/audio interface, it wasn't the little mixer.

The source - the new laptop's charger. When I unplugged it, the noise vanished. Zero background noise, very clean audio

It was slightly quieter when plugging the laptop into a totally different socket on the other side of the room, but still there. The noise ALSO still happens when the mini-mixer had that laptop's channel MUTED! I really don't get it...

Anyone ANY ideas?",t2_o9395nv,21

Why do guitar amp manufacturers advertise about how great their amps' bass frequency response is?,"It's relatively common for guitar amps to be advertised using phrases like ""huge, monstrous bass"" and other marketing terms regarding the impressiveness of how bass frequencies are reproduced by the amp. 

Is this a mere marketing gimmick oriented toward guitar players who either don't know or don't care how the amount of bass in their tone might interact negatively with the tone of the band's bassist? When guitar amp manufacturers advertise how great the bass response of their amp is, are they also necessarily referring to the extent to which their amp will compete with a bass guitar? 

I guess my question is whether an amp being advertised as having ""huge bass"" could translate into anything musically useful in the context of a band without necessitating that the bass guitar take up less space. If ""bass"" simply means frequencies from roughly 40 Hz to 300Hz, doesn't any advertisement about a guitar amps great bass presence mean that the bass guitar will have to be attenuated to compensate?",t2_9tmid,2

The place I'm struggling to make a decision is with my corner bass trap design - particularly the floor to ceiling corners.

budget is low, why we won’t separate control room and studio or build a room in room construction. the idea is basically to record our band on multiple tracks while jamming or rehearsing and for the producers to have a somewhat nice sounding room while being able to record external musicians.

it’s a basement room of ca 50sqm with tapestry and plasterboard walls and ceiling.

since none of us has ever done this before, we don’t know what’s best for the room. has anyone experience with an opened control room like this? should we stick to the live end, dead end principle?

i‘m very excited about this and would be happy to hear what you guys think!",t2_ssnpa,4

Anyone successfully rocking Hackintosh as their primary machine for mixing/tracking/production in a professional environment?,"Anyone successfully rocking Hackintosh as their primary machine for mixing/tracking/production  in a professional environment?

I tried it once upon a time (~2013), and concluded that it was too risky.  Has it gotten any better in recent years?  Specifically, if there's anyone who trusts a Hackintosh for their day-to-day rig, I'd love to hear from you.  

For instance, do you still have to keep updating .kexts and whatnot every time Apple releases an OS update?

etc. 

Thanks!",t2_ad4x7,35
Has anybody used both older and more recent Oktava Mk-012s?,"I'm currently in the market for a new pair of matched SDCs, and the Oktava Mk-012s really keep catching my eye. The only ""problem"" I see is that, in older production runs, they had quality control issues that ultimately led to Michael Joly's OktavaMod company. 

As Joly has gotten out of the business of modding mics, I'm curious if anybody here has experience with older 012s and a newer pair. If so, does it seem like Oktava has ironed out the QC issues they were having?",t2_cd159,1

Suggestions on Setting Pricing?,"I run a small studio out of my apartment and specialize in vocals, guitar (acoustic, electric, and bass), beat production, and mixing for digital release.

Console EQ Plug-ins?,"This may sound like a real dumb question but,

Can someone describe to purpose of using emulated (Ex Waves API series) console EQ’s inside the box?

I understand the SSL Compressors and such because of the classic sound (and warmth of course).

But what about these EQ’s are useful besides gorgeous and lush cuts at certain intervals compared to the versatility of a state of the art EQ (Ex Fab Filter Q2)

Please do not thrash me for an ignorant question, I just want knowledge.

"Mixing EDM, am I doing this right and how can I improve?","Hey, I'm mostly drum &amp; bass/techno producer. I wanted to ask you for advice. This is my usual mixing process when producing a track.

I put limiter on the master so the max volume is -6db (I know I shouldn't but haven't found workaround yet). I rely mostly on audio levels because this works best for me. All elements in my tracks always have fixed volume levels:

\- kick and snare: -10db,

\- sub bass (sidechained) and mids: -14db,

\- percussions: -16db,

\- pads and synths: -20 to -16db,

\- cymbals and shakers: -24 to -21db

People often compliment my mixing and this works fairly well on deeper/calmer tunes, but when there comes a little more distortion and saturation the mix doesn't work quite right anymore. Do you know any useful tips and techniques?",t2_ma3v2,0
Is this a thing already?,"So I thought of a program that can be made (Unless it's already a thing) where you could build a floor plan and designate a spot where the audio source is coming from and the program would calculate the room, things in the room and the walls. Then it would apply the effects to make the sound fit the setting (E.g. reverb, eq, amplify, ect.). 

Say there was a narrator and you wanted him to sound like he was sitting next to or moving around you and your both in a church. With the program you could build the floor plan of the church and program the path of the voice, then the program would calculate the distance of the voice to apply any amplification, and if your subject walks around a wall the program would calculate the thickness and material of the wall and change the voice to match what it would accurately sound like. 


Is this a thing already and if it's not, why not? ",t2_12igvs,68
Using a single reverb/delay on all parts in a mix?,"I've toyed with this idea for a little while, but finally gone through with it; I set up my latest mixing project so that all of the individual components of the track (drums, guitar, 'body') go through a single reverb and delay auxiliary, to try and create a greater sense of cohesion and 'room' in the mix. It's hi-passed at around 4000Hz to cut out any low end rumble, and the bass doesn't go through it at all.

So far I'm really pleased with the results, but are there any pitfalls I should be aware of? Does anyone else here do it this way?",t2_d5yav,9

Recording keys with Keyscape,"Hi all. So, I'm a piano player that wants to record a few instrumental albums. I have limited working knowledge of DAWs and understanding of mixing/mastering. However, I am learning and know the basics. I was wondering your thoughts on recording MIDI from my keyboard(Yamaha DGX-660)and then using Keyscape pianos for the sounds? I did it for a simple Christmas album, that a friend produced, and he used pianos from some sort of Abbey Road suite and I like the results.

What do you think would be the easiest way to accomplish this? I haven't bought the Keyscape package yet, going to be my Christmas present to myself, so will it be better to get Omnishphere or just use my Protools to record? Does Omnisphere have the option to record the audio as it's played? Thanks for your help and thoughts...

Midi Drums too sensitive?,"First off I'd like to say that I am not a drummer...

Whenever I record my midi drums, the snare always registers 3 or 4 extra hits after the first initial hit.

Why people don’t trust in Us?,"Today there’s a choir where I work. A friend of this guys want to record the performance on an analog outboard (for vinyl). He tells me that he do this for “passion” and He doesn’t know how to record properly, I give him my help for record.

Every single second of the perfomance He try to “fix” that, “fix” this, frequency are “muddy”, “why the L meter is lower than the R meter?”.

I can guarantee that the record is nice and clean, I promise u but.... why? And... why this type of people doesn’t listen to the stuff while they lost their minds on meters and other “bullshit”? Why they doesn’t trust in Us?

Help! In over my head,"TL;DR - Wanted a career change early in life and started doing work for a sound production company. Didn't even know what an XLR cable was, but they liked me enough to bring me to more gigs. I'm still not confident in what I'm doing though so I'm looking for any free books/courses/resources to study up with before the next gig on New Year's

Hello! I used to be majoring in Computer Science, but after working in the field for a few years already hated it. I've always loved music and been interested in getting more involved with the music industry, so one day when I saw an ad looking for help with our yearly local music fest I Joined. I had 0 knowledge about anything audio related, but I did what I was told, did it safetly and correctly, and stayed out of the way. As the amount of crew needed got smaller, I was continuously invited back.

Now, I just got asked to help with our towns new year ball drop by the company's owner (the company does light and sound production for local events/festivals/concerts). I want to show him that I'm serious about getting into the industry and know my shit, but I really don't know my shit. I never studied anything related in college, and after withdrawing before getting my CS degree can't financially go back. I've tried learning independently, but without even a base level of knowledge it's difficult. 

I'm eager and willing to put the time and dedication in, but just don't know where to start. I'm looking for a kind of 'audio tech for dummies' guide to get started with, or any pointers to the kind of stuff I should be looking for and what I would be expected to know. Any tips and help is greatly appreciated. Thank you everyone for reading",t2_rrwp2,0
Anyone else think that 80s production aged much worse than even the 50s or 60s?,"Seriously, that sterile early digital sound makes some albums borderline unlistenable to me. Terrible sounding drums, bright cheesy synths, fake-ass reverb, all tracks detached from one another. Blonde on Blonde from the 60s sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday, same with The Beatles' stuff. Then Dylan and McCartney's stuff in the 80s sounds (sonically) like trash, so cold and aloof. Love some 80s music but can't stand the production - I wish The Smiths had been around ten years earlier or later! What do you think, am I way off base here?",t2_sfmnp,48

Are top tier engineers / producers accessible?,"I’m taking a class next quarter which has a requirement that I interview a successful industry professional. I know a handful of very successful performers but I’m studying music production so I thought it would be more valuable to interview a producer or engineer. 

I thought I’d throw some hail mary’s to producers and engineers from some of my favorite albums (i.e. Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake) in hopes that they may be willing to sit for an interview or answer a few questions via e-mail.  However, I can’t seem to find any websites or contact information for any of them.  I kind of expected that they would all have websites where I could at least send an inquiry, even if it’s ignored. 

Am I underestimating the celebrity status of grammy-winning engineers and producers?  Am I doing the equivalent of asking Taylor Swift for an interview?
