Is a ThunderBolt audio interface worth it for a small home studio?,"Right now I record through a crappy AudioBox USB from many years ago and feels it’s time to upgrade.  

I play a Fender Strat and have a Moog mono synth, and Elektron’s Digitone, Digitakt, and Analog Four. This leaves me needing preferably 6 inputs, as I’ll probably route one Elektron into the other at a minimum. I’d also like a bit of room for expansion. So let’s say max even in a few years I’ll need 12 inputs even if I need a secondary preamp. Is ThunderBolt worth it or should I save some cash and just go for USB? I’m looking for an improvement in sound quality (better preamps) and also a reduction in noise, which could be completely my fault and not the AudioBox USB’s, I’ve still got a few things to try and get rid of the noise. 

My biggest pet peeve though is the latency between playback and input. So when I want to jam over something I recorded I have to put the mixer in the center and everything has a huge delay on it which is terrible for my productivity and the volumes are low overall hearing wise. The direct to DAW input is very enticing for me but I still do not know if it is worth the $1,000. Any help is appreciated.

What’s the difference b/w dithering and truncation?,"It’s my basic understanding that dithering is adding low, inaudible noises to cut off distortion and that it’s the final step to the mastering process while truncation is simply cutting off bit resolutions which in turn creates quantization errors.

Getting wide auto-panning to sound right/auto-panning tricks &amp; tips,"I’ve noticed that a lot of songs I really enjoy use a good bit of auto-panning (Dave Fridmann seems to really like using it).  The sounds tend to be shakers, tambourines, or higher-pitched dreamy sounding synths.

I tend to have a hard time making auto-panned sounds fit in the mix well. The element easily starts to seem too on top of the mix, one-dimensional and obnoxious.

I have tried widening the sound before and after auto-panning.  I’ve also tried using reverb after the auto-panning, but I still am not getting the sound I’m looking for in most cases.

How do you separate multi-track's onto different desk channels?,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub or a really stupid question but;

Planning to buy some equipment and set up a home studio (not really a studio) to get a grips with the really in-depth mixing and EQ stuff; obviously without any live input this will rely on multi-tracks; I dont understand how it can go from the main file; to being patched onto different desk channels; surely the desk still sees it as ONE input as it will just be a signal from a laptop?? is it software that can separate it up so the desk sees it as different inputs?

Static hiss coming from laptop when using headphones,"I have a laptop that I can hear noise from when there should be silence.

Suggestions for Isolating Small Studio Room on a Budget?,"Hi all,

Opened up my new mixing room here in Brooklyn and I'm trying to figure out the cheapest, most efficient way to isolate the noise in my room and prevent it from hitting my neighbors. I'm in a multi-faceted studio building with many tenants, and I have 2 neighbors on either side of me. Turns out the walls do not have any insulation installed between them; only 2 panels of sheetrock against studs. 

My room is 115 SF. It's small, but it's enough for what I do. So, I don't really have the space to build a room-within-room setup. I've already been lectured about how having more mass will be the best solution, but I just don't have that kind of space. I'm looking for a solution that will at least dampen my output to the neighbors.

P.S. I considered posting to r/acoustics but their community is a lot smaller than this one, so I figured I'd give it a shot here!",t2_66xu4,2,0,"Suggestions for Isolating Small Studio Room on a Budget? Hi all,

Gold Star Studios Chambers (isolated Ronettes recording),"I'm a fanatic for that old Gold Star/Phil Spector sound, and I just heard this for the first time.  The claps at the beginning and Ronnie's opening ""Woah-oh""s might be the cleanest isolated example of the sound and long decay of the chambers at Gold Star.  (The tails overlap, but it sounds like it might be at least a good 3 seconds.)

(Edit: I got a rough estimate from one of the long claps and counting/converting the BPM, and it's around 3.1 seconds, at least on a cell phone speaker)

Question about level clipping while mixing drums?,"Tried this in another sub but got no response, please let me know if this is more appropriate in another sub:

Firstly, it it's worth mentioning, I'm using reaper on Windows 10.

Wondering if anyone else has this issue while mixing, specifically with drums. First off, I make sure I record my levels peaking ~  -6db. I take time to make sure my source is the best it can be before it goes into the DAW. When I'm mixing, I watch my levels and main fader to make sure I'm not peaking above -12db, and yet...my drums can't stop clipping!

The only effects I'm adding on my 4 tracks are EQ, light compression and light reverb. I don't hear clipping, they sound good, but I have to either turn down my main fader like 15-25% to avoid seeing the levels clip or turn down the individual faders a lot.

The other problem I have is when I do have a good drum sound, when I slowly begin to ease my other instruments in, the drums become buried in the mix and it makes it feel like all the processing I did is never heard. If I do hear the drums, I have to keep my instruments down, but then that makes the mix sound sort of lop sided and weak.

I also use high pass filters on my guitars/vocals and generally try to remove any unnecessary frequencies, but I'm still learning at using a fully parametric (visual) EQ effectively.

Appreciate any suggestions or input. Thanks!",t2_4o9pk38,1,0,"Question about level clipping while mixing drums? Tried this in another sub but got no response, please let me know if this is more appropriate in another sub:

Some questions before I start mixing my band's somewhat dense post-rock-ish EP," I'm about to start mixing my new band\\'s new music and thought I\\'d spew some questions to hopefully guide me well. I've always mixed my bands, and always thought they turned out pretty decent, but could be better.

Any general tips on semi-dense music, containing sections with 3 reverb/delay-laden guitars, all double-mic\\'d (an sm57 and a fathead)...sometimes a more rhythmic part along with a lead, sometimes just 2 or 3 riffy/arpeggio'd parts, sometimes two rhythmic parts with kind of alternating high notes so the rhythm(s) contain the leads. Basically tips on parsing things like that and placing them well and all that.

More specific questions:

* I see often people saying to mix in mono to place everything in the right spot, frequency-wise. That makes sense, but I feel like multiple guitar parts REQUIRE panning. I mean you don\\'t (often) cut frequencies in one guitar to make room for another, do you? Or do you? And either way, is mixing in mono to start with a universally agreed upon method or are there downsides? Should I do it with all the non-guitar instruments, and carve out a spot for ALL the guitars to live, then pan to get the guitars sounding good? I've never tried starting in mono.
* We\\'re using programmed drums with superior drummer. I think I've got them sounding PRETTY natural by sending them all to the same reverb, and with superior drummer\\'s humanizing stuff, but any other tips for making unreal drums sound real (other than the programming itself)?
* I feel like in more emotional, less...steady and \\""rocking\\"" music, the kick should be more felt than heard. Is this a common belief? Whenever I can hear the click really clearly in post-rock music, it feels weird. Am I alone in that? Any tips for mixing kick?
* If you were to approach mixing a band like Explosions in the Sky but with vocals, what would you do with the vocals to still make them clear while also not detracting too much from the music. I've seen bands go to both extremes...like Appleseed Cast had an album where the vocals were heavily effected. And Foxing had an album where the vocals were up front and clear. Maybe somewhere in between? What do you think? My bands have always suffered from being \\""music for musicians\\"" and I\\'m trying to change that with this one by making it a little more accessible in the mix. To me that means clearer and more up front vocals, but I do want the musical subtleties and stuff to come through, since that really is our focus.

I don\\'t know if this breaks rule 4, hopefully not since I asked a lot of specific questions, but here\\'s a rough mix of one of our songs to give an idea of our style. Any general thoughts on what you\\'d do different would be great. I have plenty of issues with this mix...sibilance, drums, and just a bunch of tweaks I\\'d make, but would love to hear your thoughts...as I think a lot of mixing advice is geared towards making like...ROCK music and I don\\'t feel like that\\'s really what we are.

Missing 10k+ in my mix?,"I was comparing a mix of mine to a commercial release by LUFS-matching the two tracks and then comparing key frequency bands. I found that all frequency bands were within +/- 2db of the commercial release except for the 10k+ range which was much quieter in my mix than in the commercial release.

Are there any very common reasons for this to occur?

&amp;#x200B;

My best guesses are: 

1. The commercial release had somewhat more electronic instrumentation. Would the overtones of these instruments reach higher than other non-electronic instruments?
2. The commercial release was a lossy format while my mix was a .wav file. Could the lossy format add information (distortion?) in the 10k+ range?
3. Are commercial mixes often given a big 10k+ EQ boost on the mix bus?

1. The commercial release had somewhat more electronic instrumentation. Would the overtones of these instruments reach higher than other non-electronic instruments?
2. The commercial release was a lossy format while my mix was a .wav file. Could the lossy format add information (distortion?) in the 10k+ range?
3. Are commercial mixes often given a big 10k+ EQ boost on the mix bus? 
4. With regards to frequencies greater than 10kHz, am I just generally stupid and deficient?"

How much soundproofing do you actually need for vocals?,"I've been looking at options for soundproofing, creating a small booth, putting huge blankets all over the place... But it all seems a bit overkill for what i actually need it for. It's only for vocals, i live in a terrace house and the walls are kinda thin so it makes me really self-conscious about singing loud so it limits my range.  I've even thought about making a small soundproof box to put over my head, as ridiculous as it sounds, at least it would get the job done and it would probably be cheap to make though i'm sure there would be issues with comb filtering and airflow i bet.

Possibly the dumbest question ever posted here but... How do you get a reference track?,"Okay so before you laugh to hard, all of the music I have is either streaming or from iTunes. 

Streaming obviously comes across in low quality and I cant set it in my project. Purchase from iTunes do not give you 24bit wave files, which honestly I do not know if that is necessary or not? I could pull a song off youtube, but again, low quality.

Question About Phase,"I understand the importance of making sure mics are in-phase during both recording and mixing, but when working ITB is there any reason you can't just zoom in on the waveforms and line up peaks with peaks/troughs with troughs visually? I see a lot of dudes using plugins like Sound Radix Auto-Align for lining up polarity but it seems like an unnecessary gadget when you can just get different sources in phase by referencing sharp transient across several tracks, i.e. a rimshot on the snare. I did this on a project recently and really beefed up a snare in a way that simply flipping the polarity couldn't accomplish. Any input or just general phase discussion much appreciated :-)",t2_63z3k,3,0,"Question About Phase I understand the importance of making sure mics are in-phase during both recording and mixing, but when working ITB is there any reason you can't just zoom in on the waveforms and line up peaks with peaks/troughs with troughs visually?

Waves Free Mixing Course with Dave Darlington / reference track question,"Just found this sub today, and I’m glad, because I really want to become the best audio producer/mixer guy I possibly can.  I’ve been self producing/mixing a record for 9 months (ive done several records in the past ten years but this is the most seriously I’ve ever taken it). I am of course also the artist and the writer and blah blah, we are in the age of many hats. 

Wondering if anyone has watched this Waves series? I’ve found it extremely useful. Not always gonna have all the plugins mentioned but just watching pros go at it and talk about their process and why they make their choices is really cool. I’m not done watching them really but one questions that really stands out to me is this: 


When using a reference track, wouldn’t that track already be mastered? How is it helpful to reference a fully mastered track with a track that’s in the mix phase? Like it feels like using a mainstream released track for reference when mastering makes sense, but how are we supposed to get hold of the mixes??

Power adapter question for audio interface,"I just bought an old used Scarlett 18i6, and it didn’t include the power adapter. I plugged in a 12V adapter rated for 350mA, and all I saw in the mixcontrol software was a full meter of static on every analog channel. It’s asking for 12V 1A, so I assume that the static was a result of under powering the device. 

My local Best Buy sells an AC-DC adapter, variable voltage (up to 12V) and rated for 1.3A. Will this power adapter work for my interface? I assume that even though it’s rated for 1.3A, the interface will only draw as much current as it needs. 

Is there a flaw in my logic here? Also, do you think I’m correct in my theory that the static on every channel is due to under powering the interface? The seller said that it was fully functional, and he had a number of good reviews. 
Thanks!


UPDATE: 12V 1A power supply worked great, thankfully it looks like under-powering via current didn't do any damage.

How do you personally use track sends in a DAW? Are the typical dual send knobs per track in DAWs an obsolete artifact from analog days? Or am I missing out by not using them?,"I don't use them. When I want reverb on a track I add it to that track and tailor it for that track. Same with any other audio effect.

So is the way they are incorporated into DAWs vestigial? Or is there still importance behind shared effects over individual? Is there a way I could be effectually using the sends? Can having the same effect on multiple tracks somehow pull a song together in some way? Or is it simply just for the convenience of ""well, I always set my [whatever effect] the same no matter what so might as well just do it once""?

Are behringer products that bad?,"I feel like having behringer products is kind of a taboo in live mixing (not sure if it applies to studio work). At my school we have a X32 and it works.

Monitoring Problems,"I am mixing using Yamaha HS7s.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm having is that I get the mix sounding good in the monitoring environment, but when I take the mix to my hi-fi, it is far too bass heavy. I have to work on the mix, and then reference on the hi-fi, only to find that there are still too many bassy undertones.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mixing a jazz quartet, and the problem is the upright bass. It was recorded with both a bridge mic and a DI. Both have 50hz high pass filters on them, and are peaking at about -18 on the faders, but it still sounds too much through hi-fi and even my pc speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I go down to 44.1 when I’ve been doing 88.2 or 96?,"In another thread on here I was completely surprised to see that the consensus was that tracking at 44.1k was the norm. At the studio I’ve been recording at, they’d never be caught dead tracking at anything below 96k. I often do 88.2. And always 24 bit depth. My projects eat up space fast, and it would be nice to have smaller file sizes. Also my computer can handle it better when the projects aren’t so data heavy. 

Can 44.1k sound great then? I’ve been lectured by my producer many times about why 96k is the best. And how like plugins, mixing, mastering want better data I guess, and then you shrink it down for the consumer. Kind of like shooting in 4K but releasing a video in HD.

Having issues with a producer,"tl;dr Our producer's not what I expected and there's tension in the band/studio that may necessitate change.


Two years ago my band started production of our first full-length album with a guy who was just putting his foot in the door with owning his own studio. He didn't have the capability to record live drums and didn't have the confidence to record live bass, and so programmed both. He didn't think our lead guitarist picked hard enough, and re-did his rhythm parts (wrong, in a few spots) on his own rather than work it out with the guy who wrote them. He's seen us live a few times and knows what *we* sound like as a band, but that sound didn't make it through production.

Well, we finally got around to starting on the next album about two months ago and the rest of the band agreed to keep working with the same guy. By now he's in a new building, has a good drum room, and feels confident enough to work with low end. But I'm not sure we're well off. 

Most bands in our genre program drums. We have one hell of a good drummer who's  actually played on only one or two tracks in the past 10(?) years he's been in the scene, maybe more, and has almost nothing to show for his efforts. I'm not convinced the rest of the guys see the *need* to have him on the record and it's clear as day our producer's too saturated in our scene culture push anything. 

On the first day of recording, he apparently told our new rhythm guitarist that he's too good to re-record. So he's probably still not interested in recording *us* like we're paying him to. 

Then comes day three. As we're working out some song structures I look over his screen and see he's recording at 44.1khz. Now, I trust my own ears and the relief of peace of mind over any science and wouldn't dare track anything under 24/48, and mention this to him. He refutes with something about how 48khz takes up too much space/processing power or what not, nothing close to a realistic excuse to me, but I thought we wound up having a civil discussion about it all. He came across as calm and collected, maybe a little proud or amused, but everyone else in the room got a bit alarmed, telling me not to pick fights with the producer, and I remember being taken out to the balcony for a cig and to ""cool down"" or whatever they thought I needed. 

I came out of it thinking ""If this is how we butt heads, we're gonna get along great"". Again, it was a civil conversation. I don't know *what* everyone else could have possibly heard to think otherwise. 

But maybe I shouldn't have been so optimistic: he's apparently been open with others in the band about how whatever I said ""pissed him off"". They're all convinced. I don't know where I stand in his eyes, but with the lack of communication here plus everything that went wrong with the last album I *reeallly* do not want to continue with him. 

The last time I recorded with other people was basically just two or three noobs yelling and poking fun at each other until we got a good mix. *That* somehow worked. *This* is making me fucking nervous. 

Right now I'm half afraid to give input for my own album. Maybe it's my anxiety, but something about the guys' dispositions isn't giving me warm fuzzies about our upcoming sessions.

"Drum Kit Saturation – By track, whole kit, or both?","Yes I know that ***""it depends""***. I'm looking for a rule-of-thumb.

How should saturation be approached for multi-track percussion? Yes the kick will likely be saturated, but then you go ""hey, saturation sounds good on the hi-hat too,"" etcetera, because saturation makes everything sound better and that can't be the proper way to decide to use it or not.

So if you're saturating many tracks of a drumkit individually, would it not be better to saturate the bus for the entire kit instead?

"Audio ends up sounding quiet and slightly lacking in ""presence""; anything I can do?","So, I do gaming videos on YouTube, and something I've been trying to figure out is my audio. I've never been great at understanding audio, and how to make it sound good. Now, my audio is actually fine, technically. Or, rather, it's not bad. I'm just a bit nitpicky, and I'm trying to see if there's any tweaks I can make to make it sound better.

I'm not even really sure how to describe what bugs me about my audio. The best way I can put it is, when I watch a video or stream of someone else, their audio sounds as though they're right there in the room with me, yet when I watch my own videos back, it sounds like I'm ""watching a video"". Does that make sense? It's not bad, but it's just slightly... off. It also sounds a touch quieter than a typical ""pro"" YT video, which I don't understand.

My process for recording and processing my audio is as follows:

​

- I record in OBS, with the commentary audio on a separate track. I use OBS filters for noise suppression and noise gate, and I also use a compressor filter with the following settings:

Ratio (X:1): 3

Threshold (dB): -30

Attack (ms): 1

Release(ms): 60

- I import the audio into Audacity, and use Equalization to boost the bass and treble, I use the hard limiter to even out the audio a bit, then normalize to -1, and use noise removal to clean up any extra background noise/ frequencies. I export the audio as a WAV file (with whatever the default settings Audacity uses for that).

- I edit my videos in Premiere (Elements), and when I export them out to a final video, it uses 320kbps AAC audio. The audio format options are either AAC, Dolby Digital, or MPEG.

​
I record in a small room, and while I don't have any kind of noise proof padding, I've seen other channels that record in a similar type of room that still sound better than mine.

Is there anything in there that could be tweaked to help me out? I really don't know what to tweak or how to tweak it.

Someone suggested I ditch the noise suppressor in OBS, and I tried that, but I don't hear any noticeable difference, other than a more noticeable ""hissing"" frequency.

I was wondering if perhaps the compressor is what's causing my issue, but I also like the idea of a compressor (as, to my understanding, it helps to keep the audio relatively consistent throughout, which is nice, because I sometimes get really quiet and really loud at random intervals). Do bigger YTers/ streamers not use compressors? Is that not actually a thing?

Stereo/Mono/Phase invert and for mixing &amp; mastering for vinyl,"I am very much a beginner at mixing and mastering, but I am working on masters for vinyl (for want of money, not lack of faith in professional engineers) and am trying to reduce stereo low end on a mix. I think I am doing okay because when I test the mix in mono mode, the low end of bass and drums doesn't move at all, just seems like some of the high end on synths and shakers etc are spread out a bit more in stereo vs mono. When I do phase invert on either L or R, not much changes. When I do a mono   + phase invert on either channel, the low end and bass and drums mostly disappears, which I'm taking to mean that if you isolate far L or R, there's only high end information there, which would be good for vinyl because you don't wan't low frequencies on the wide ends of the stereo field or it will cause skips. Am I right about this, or should you be able to still hear low end in that phase invert + mono monitoring? Thanks in advance for anybody that takes time to answer this.

EDIT: Thanks all so much for your advice, so helpful. Also I should clarify to address some other concerns that were raised: I am in contact with the cutting engineer, and I'm at this stage because my first set of masters had too much stereo bass information, so I'll get feedback on the next pass.

&gt;Put simply, all files must fall within a specific volume range. By keeping all files within this range - not too loud and not too soft - listeners won't have to constantly adjust the volume of their playback device.

But the next guideline reads:

&gt;**Each file must have peak values no higher than -3dB.**

&gt;By leaving this headroom you'll reduce the possibility of distortion, which can reduce the quality of the listening experience. This headroom is also needed to ensure files are successfully encoded. 

These two seem contradictory to me, as the first one seems to say that there can't be any sound higher than -18dB, but the second suggests that there can be sound up to -3dB.

The importance of a consistent workflow (or presets work too I guess),"I'm in the mildly agonizing process of mixing my next release, and ran into a major facepalm moment today. One song has been irritating me for weeks because it was coming off extremely muddy and I had no idea why. It's an instrumental tune and I DI everything so there's no way it was room noise or anything. I messed with EQ on every instrument at least 10 times and couldn't get it to sit right. I gave up and decided to come back later (always good advice).

&amp;#x200B;

Another song was coming across way too sterile and didn't have enough punch. I had the brilliant realization that I probably needed to adjust the high pass on the reverb. I decided to cross-reference the reverb's high pass on the other songs to try to unify them a bit more. I go back to the instrumental track to check on the reverb and...never did it. That would certainly explain the mud.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say I now have a preset on both my EQ plugin and reverb so that doesn't happen again. Literally hours of agony because I'm a total idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

And while I was typing this I went back to inspect some vocals that were misbehaving. I went to adjust the DeEsser and naturally I never set that up either.

Anyone else using Auto-Tune Pro or other Antares software?,"I’ve always been a huge fan of Antares software because also being heavily interested in computers, I’ve always been fascinated by the algorithms that must work behind their plugins, especially Auto-Tune. I also found a bug one time in one of the minor releases of Auto-Tune 7 and emailed them about it, and one of the developers actually called me to talk about it while I helped him reproduce it on his machine so they could fix it in the next release. That was really cool being a programmer, and being a teenager at the time knowing that I was the reason a bug in a piece of software used in thousands of major studios around the world got fixed with the next update, haha. 

Anyways, I’ve been using Auto-Tune since I purchased the boxed version of Auto-Tune Evo several years ago and I’ve purchased every single update since. So as soon as Auto-Tune Pro came out I bought the update, and I’ve been using it for several months. I really like the new UI design and I think it was a well-needed refresh.

However, when it comes to actually working with it, I’m really disappointed. It’s buggy as hell. 

First off, when they first released version 9.0.0, there was a bug where the update window would pop up *every single time* you’d open up the plugin telling you that an update was available to version 9.0.0, even though that was the version you were running. Antares quickly pushed out 9.0.1 within a matter of days, a release specifically to address this bug. But what concerns me is exactly how did the developers manage to miss that? How do you miss a bug that obvious that occurs *every single time* the plugin is opened?

Secondly, it’s super unstable. It seems to be better in automatic mode, but in graphical mode it randomly crashes Logic Pro quite frequently (like every 5 minutes). I thought maybe it was an issue with Logic, so I tried it in Reaper instead, and same thing.

Lastly, there are just random minor bugs throughout. For example, in graphical mode, the adjust vibrato knob literally does nothing on line objects. I thought maybe this was just missing functionality for line objects, but according to the manual, it should. Sometimes the cursor in graphical mode also randomly jumps while you’re drawing an object, which is really annoying.

I don’t know, I feel like Antares has really dropped the ball with this one, and I’m kind of disappointed, especially since I’ve been a loyal customer of their’s for years. It almost seems like Auto-Tune Pro was hyped up by Antares at all these producer and audio engineering conferences, just to be rushed to release long before it had gone through proper testing for bugs and stability. I think I’m going to switch back to 8.1 for now until they release the next patch because sonically the two releases are supposedly the same, but who knows when the next patch for Auto-Tune Pro will be. We’ve already been stuck with version 9.0.1 for about half a year, when I’m sure I can’t be the only one that has noticed these bugs.

Will I EVER understand compression...?,"Ahh yes, my monthly compression post...

I 'get' the idea of compression but I am struggling SO much with how to hear what is reasonable/appropriate/too much when adding compression. Here's my understanding and PLEASE correct me on any or all of this:

Threshold: The point where the plug in actually kicks in.

Ratio: How much of the sound over the threshold is compressed.

Attack: Length of time before Compression kicks in

Release: How long compression is held for

Makeup Gain: Getting the 'lost' volume back from the compression.

I'm trying to start with understanding the Logic house compressors, I've picked one to learn, Studio FET. 

My problem is, I can see the needle move and know something is happening but I just can't tell if I've found a sweet spot.

I have a lot of recorded vocals and acoustic guitar, so plenty to work with, I just need to know what I'm listening for and how to know when I've done it 'right'...which I know is subjective.

Most of the tutorial on yt don't connect by XlR cable so i came to ask this sub.
Also, what is a ground signal?"

Mixes lacking energy and punch,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been recording and mixing for a few years now and I feel as though I have a grasp on the fundamentals. I mainly work on rap and R&amp;B but do the odd rock record here and there. Lately I’ve been comparing my mixes with industry ones, and the one thing I’ve noticed is a considerable difference in loudness, energy and punch. A couple of things I do notice on big records these days is that the vocals are loud as hell and in your face, the 808 or synth bass and kick are the second loudest, and the snare or clap is tucked neatly right behind the lead vocal. (Couple tracks I’m referencing are No Stylist by French Montana and Kika by Tory Lanez) 

I’ve tried so many techniques, parallel compression, rear buss compression, M/S EQ, saturation, soft clipping on drums, etc. No matter what I do I find I still can’t get that “sound” that I hear in those records. 

The last thing is that I’m scared to death of making my tracks too loud for Spotify as it just turns them way down, as I’ve received some nasty emails from clients in the past about this.

If you’re interested I can post some of my work. I figured this is the best support system I have, might as well see what the community has to say.

What would happen if you subtracted frequencies of one sound from another?,"So sidechain compression is used to say, make the bass quieter so the kick can come through.

Cost of Rehearsal Studio Buildout,"Hey everyone, hoping for some direction here...

I am in the process of buying the business assets of a rehearsal studio building. However, the building itself will not be around much longer, and we need to find a new place to go. I have probably 4 months before the owners of the new building would start swinging a hammer, unless I can convince them otherwise.

In the past week my head has been spinning doing my own research on the cost of construction for these types of studios and what is truly required. It’s been all over the map, literally from $25/sf to $250/sf. I’ve also been told that a new construction on land is financially off the table, compared to finding something that already exists and doing a buildout.

The current studio has more than 20 units. Most of which are 180 sf trapezoidal practice rooms, with a couple higher grade areas of 800-1000 sf with light racks and leprecon controllers for larger acts and hourly rental.

There’s not a single right angle anywhere. All areas between the halls and units are double dry walled (air in between, not insulation), two sets of regular old doors, and the ceiling was hung suspended independently of each unit, with tiles to capture noise. As for the floor... it’s concrete and there is some travel between units; they compensated by cutting grooves into the foundation and placing wedges (I’m sure that’s not the technical term) between units in the areas between the double drywall.

The largest speakers in the building are Meyer CQ1’s and a lot of 4x12s, with quite a few ISP 500 watt wedge monitors on stage. Buttkickers are used pretty frequently by larger acts that come in, and in my experience do travel between the units. Those are in the  larger spaces by the way... the smaller 180 sf spaces have minimal equipment, or the musicians will bring their own (usually non-stack) amps. Foam wall pads are sparsely scattered throughout and all look second-hand / salvaged.

This is by far the best constructed “non professional” rehearsal space I’ve used, the way. My first space I rented 20 years ago was in an abandoned leather building, and the other space I had rented out was an old elementary school. Both of them basically just lined the walls with carpet and called it a day. 

Now, if we do lose the building and I’m forced to start anew, I have a lot of questions in order to maximize my investment. I’m not sure each of the practice rooms need the Cadillac treatment, but I don’t want my tenants surrounded by rotting carpet either. So I’m open to opinions on where to shoot for, quality wise. Other than that...

A) what should I be looking for in a building? An empty shell? An office to retrofit? I’m assuming single floor. How about height?

B) Construction labor rates are quite high at this time thanks to the booming economy, and the last thing i want is to end up with double costs in twice the timeframe. Are there any tips here on managing this? Are there pre-fab materials I can use to get a better handle on exact costing? Or would that be astronomical in comparison? In a perfect world I would want to be able to accurately cost the 180 sf practice pods, and then get creative with the larger spaces to accommodate to the crowd that would be willing to pay more daily/monthly.

C) are there specific “gurus” in this industry that cater to these types of buildings? In the past couple weeks I have gotten a lot of head scratching from financiers, contractors, and architects who can’t quite wrap their heads around the concept of these spaces. It would be great to find a resource to help me get right to the point.

D) Am I completely crazy? Any sage words of advice from someone who’s ever been in a similar situation?

I really appreciate the help here. It would be the achievement of a lifetime to save this space. I just now wish I had a few years of construction management under my belt...

Thanks all, you’re helping someone fulfill a dream here.

EQ and Compression in Analog Signal Flow?,"How do EQ and compressors operate in an analog context?

I ask because I have been working strictly in the box for my entire time as a producer.

I simply can't imagine that a separate compressor and EQ would be acting upon each channel at once in an analog mix (as would be the case in a DAW).

Is each track printed after the desired settings are dialed in, and then the compressor or EQ can then be used to work on the next track?

The most insane/bizarre source of random noise I've ever come across....,"&amp;#x200B;

So and my brother DJ, quite a complex setup - two laptops, two controllers, synced via an Ethernet cable, audio from both laptops into a tiny little 2-channel mixer, which then goes into monitor speakers.

For a while things were pretty crappy, so we just put up with the random noise from the big monitor wedge we use. It's pretty crap, but it's fine for rehearsing and when we play live we use the club's PA system, so we'd rather spend our money elsewhere.

Yet today I introduced a new laptop to the setup, and the noise was insane - really loud, really weird, it sounded like someone had placed a tiny microphone in the CPU and amplified the volume 10000 times.

I narrowed it down to everything - it wasn't the new cables, wasn't the controller/audio interface, it wasn't the little mixer.

The source - the new laptop's charger. When I unplugged it, the noise vanished. Zero background noise, very clean audio

It was slightly quieter when plugging the laptop into a totally different socket on the other side of the room, but still there. The noise ALSO still happens when the mini-mixer had that laptop's channel MUTED! I really don't get it...

The old speakers were in a sealed enclosure with matching passive radiators.

The drivers I got out of the monitor are rectangular and have some confusing acoustics. The sound clear when you face the drivers, but without much bass. But if you point them down, you can hear more bass, but less clarity. If i try to build a little portable enclosure for them, would they need to be in an unsealed enclosure, use the passive radiators, pointed down, or forward, etc? Just curious if anyone who is a familiar with this type of driver what the acoustic considerations are. Thanks

Why do guitar amp manufacturers advertise about how great their amps' bass frequency response is?,"It's relatively common for guitar amps to be advertised using phrases like ""huge, monstrous bass"" and other marketing terms regarding the impressiveness of how bass frequencies are reproduced by the amp. 

Is this a mere marketing gimmick oriented toward guitar players who either don't know or don't care how the amount of bass in their tone might interact negatively with the tone of the band's bassist? When guitar amp manufacturers advertise how great the bass response of their amp is, are they also necessarily referring to the extent to which their amp will compete with a bass guitar? 

I guess my question is whether an amp being advertised as having ""huge bass"" could translate into anything musically useful in the context of a band without necessitating that the bass guitar take up less space.

Mastering for Spotify?,"I've been working on a song for a friend of mine, and he wants to upload it to Spotify via Distrokid.

  
However, reading I've done suggests that spotify limits tracks to -14 LUFS, while the track I'm working on is currently peaking just under there. However, it is \*very\* quiet in comparison to a lot of stuff I've listened to, or even my own music on there - with the peak being around -5dB on the levels. 

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that it's a very dense mix, with a punk rock vibe. Low end rumble taken out, all the high end that wasn't audible in the mix shelved off. I've done everything I can to make sure everything is audible, and I'm happy with how it's sounding, but it's just too quiet relative to everything else on the platform.

Which bass trap design should I choose if I am using 111kg/m3 rockwool?,"I'm doing an across-the-board acoustic treatment of my loft. I recently came into 20m2 (65 feet) of 10cm (4 inch) thick rockwool (from a cladding company that didn't need it any more and were selling it off cheap.) I'm sorted for ceiling cloud, reflection points, rear wall... I know what I'm doing with them.

The place I'm struggling to make a decision is with my corner bass trap design - particularly the floor to ceiling corners. I have enough rockwool to stack triangles in every corner - floor to ceiling - and build a frame and cover them with fabric, but this is obviously a lot more effort than just building panels and having the straddle the corner with an air-gap.

Now, the rockwool I have is pretty dense and heavy. I just weighed a 60cm x 120cm x 10cm panel, and it was 8kg. (2 feet x 4 feet x 4 inches = 17.6 pounds). An online calculator tells me that the density is therefore 111kg/m3.

Confused about my fader readings and loudness,"I am mixing an album using Cubase 10 Pro.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently,  I have been getting a lot more into the nuts and bolts, specically DBFS, LUFS, and metering. The track in question has arrived to me from the studio quite quiet. After doing some mixing and balancing, I'm getting an integrated LUFS of -31. I noticed how quiet it was when I had to turn up my speakers to hear the rough bounce of the raw recording.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to get each track to peak at -18 on my fader's meter peak level. This is -18dbfs, which is a good target, right?

My my stereo out is peaking at around -12, yet my integrated LUFS is much lower.

So, a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I ever push the faders above 0? Is this an instance where I should?
2. When would I increase the gain in the channel settings instead of pushing the fader? What's the difference?
3. Does my mix have a lot of headroom? Does this mean that I can simply push the master fader when mastering to achieve a more standard LUFS?
4. What do I do with quiet tracks? in this particular song, there are brushes on the drums which need a bit of a boost. Currently I'm bringing the other tracks down to match, but this is resulting in a quiet mix overall.  How do you deal with quiet individual tracks that are too quiet for the mix?

building a studio in a rehearsal room,"hello everyone,

i have a band and we decided to renovate our rehearsal room. before we were sharing the room with 3 other bands but we kicked them out and brought on board some producers who are willing to make this a studio and rehearsal room with us. meaning only our band equipment, monitors, pa and computer + rack + desk will be in the room.

budget is low, why we won’t separate control room and studio or build a room in room construction. the idea is basically to record our band on multiple tracks while jamming or rehearsing and for the producers to have a somewhat nice sounding room while being able to record external musicians.

Console EQ Plug-ins?,"This may sound like a real dumb question but,

Can someone describe to purpose of using emulated (Ex Waves API series) console EQ’s inside the box?

I understand the SSL Compressors and such because of the classic sound (and warmth of course).

But what about these EQ’s are useful besides gorgeous and lush cuts at certain intervals compared to the versatility of a state of the art EQ (Ex Fab Filter Q2)

"Mixing EDM, am I doing this right and how can I improve?","Hey, I'm mostly drum &amp; bass/techno producer. I wanted to ask you for advice. This is my usual mixing process when producing a track.

I put limiter on the master so the max volume is -6db (I know I shouldn't but haven't found workaround yet). I rely mostly on audio levels because this works best for me. All elements in my tracks always have fixed volume levels:

\- kick and snare: -10db,

\- sub bass (sidechained) and mids: -14db,

\- percussions: -16db,

\- pads and synths: -20 to -16db,

\- cymbals and shakers: -24 to -21db

People often compliment my mixing and this works fairly well on deeper/calmer tunes, but when there comes a little more distortion and saturation the mix doesn't work quite right anymore. Do you know any useful tips and techniques?",t2_ma3v2,0,0,"Mixing EDM, am I doing this right and how can I improve? Hey, I'm mostly drum &amp; bass/techno producer. I wanted to ask you for advice.

Is this a thing already?,"So I thought of a program that can be made (Unless it's already a thing) where you could build a floor plan and designate a spot where the audio source is coming from and the program would calculate the room, things in the room and the walls. Then it would apply the effects to make the sound fit the setting (E.g. reverb, eq, amplify, ect.). 

Say there was a narrator and you wanted him to sound like he was sitting next to or moving around you and your both in a church. With the program you could build the floor plan of the church and program the path of the voice, then the program would calculate the distance of the voice to apply any amplification, and if your subject walks around a wall the program would calculate the thickness and material of the wall and change the voice to match what it would accurately sound like.

Using a single reverb/delay on all parts in a mix?,"I've toyed with this idea for a little while, but finally gone through with it; I set up my latest mixing project so that all of the individual components of the track (drums, guitar, 'body') go through a single reverb and delay auxiliary, to try and create a greater sense of cohesion and 'room' in the mix. It's hi-passed at around 4000Hz to cut out any low end rumble, and the bass doesn't go through it at all.

So far I'm really pleased with the results, but are there any pitfalls I should be aware of? Does anyone else here do it this way?",t2_d5yav,9,0,"Using a single reverb/delay on all parts in a mix?

Recording keys with Keyscape,"Hi all. So, I'm a piano player that wants to record a few instrumental albums. I have limited working knowledge of DAWs and understanding of mixing/mastering. However, I am learning and know the basics. I was wondering your thoughts on recording MIDI from my keyboard(Yamaha DGX-660)and then using Keyscape pianos for the sounds? I did it for a simple Christmas album, that a friend produced, and he used pianos from some sort of Abbey Road suite and I like the results.

What do you think would be the easiest way to accomplish this? I haven't bought the Keyscape package yet, going to be my Christmas present to myself, so will it be better to get Omnishphere or just use my Protools to record? Does Omnisphere have the option to record the audio as it's played? Thanks for your help and thoughts...

Help! In over my head,"TL;DR - Wanted a career change early in life and started doing work for a sound production company.

Hello! I used to be majoring in Computer Science, but after working in the field for a few years already hated it. I've always loved music and been interested in getting more involved with the music industry, so one day when I saw an ad looking for help with our yearly local music fest I Joined. I had 0 knowledge about anything audio related, but I did what I was told, did it safetly and correctly, and stayed out of the way. As the amount of crew needed got smaller, I was continuously invited back.

Now, I just got asked to help with our towns new year ball drop by the company's owner (the company does light and sound production for local events/festivals/concerts). I want to show him that I'm serious about getting into the industry and know my shit, but I really don't know my shit. I never studied anything related in college, and after withdrawing before getting my CS degree can't financially go back. I've tried learning independently, but without even a base level of knowledge it's difficult. 

I'm eager and willing to put the time and dedication in, but just don't know where to start.

Am I underestimating the celebrity status of grammy-winning engineers and producers?  Am I doing the equivalent of asking Taylor Swift for an interview? Or are they just so embedded into the industry that people who need to know how to contact them know how to do it and they don’t need to put contact info online? 

Does anybody know how to find contact info for engineers and producers who have worked on successful albums?"

Between the Lines #5 - The Real World,"Hello, all.

Today's post comes to you from a 600 seat concert hall in upstate NY. The hall was originally constructed for acoustic performances, and as such is far more reverberant than we'd like for reinforced music. The seating is covered by what some of my system tech buddies jokingly call a ""dash"" array - that is, a 'line array' that's too short to exhibit any meaningful line source behavior at any frequency. Specifically, four boxes per side, which is barely enough to cover the seating area. What's more, they're all driven off a single DSP channel per side, so optimization options are few.

Since this is the type of situation that we are very likely to encounter often in the real world, I thought it might be illustrative to show what ""should"" be done in this situations vs what *can* be done.

[Here](https://imgur.com/lnmdewq) we see the house left array response over the seating area, with mic positions at the ONAX of each box in the array. [Here is an alternate view](https://imgur.com/UDDmC3H) of the same data with 1/12 oct smoothing, thicker traces, and the coherence trace visible for position ONAX A (top box, back rows). The subwoofer is muted. A lot of working with an analyzer is displaying the data in a format that's comfortable for you to parse and understand. I tend to prefer less smoothing and thin traces, but when writing or presenting I use more smoothing and thicker traces just to make the trends a little easier to see for people who may not spend all day staring at analyzers.

(EDIT: [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/a6rkp9/between_the_lines_5_the_real_world/ebz9exb) about using trace averaging is very important here. I'm not looking for trends, I'm looking to see the difference over the space. Trace averaging would completely hide the issue that is the basis of work in this post. It's a ""video solution to an audio problem."" I don't want to make the traces look better (otherwise I'd use Photoshop), I want to solve the problem that makes them look that way.)

The pink trace (ONAX A) is below the level of the others from 250 on up, and much lower above 6k3 or so. This, coupled with the relatively low coherence from being that far back in a reflective room, translates to poor intelligibility for the folks in the furthest seats who need it most. What are the textbook solutions?

**Solution 1**: More boxes. This is out, at least without a lot of budget and advanced notice: it's a permanent install, and the rigging is a deadhang so we can't easily bring the array in. We'd need to bring in motors and a rigger.

**Solution 2**: Close up the angles between the top few boxes. Besides the same logistical issues (can't bring the array down, can't pull pins out from a lift with the array hanging), we're out of coverage angle. The bottom two boxes are already at maximum splay, so by closing up the top, we'll be creating a coverage issue at the bottom. Perhaps this is preferable because front fills could be added, but they can't stay on the deck, so for most events they won't be added because people are lazy, and so we still haven't solved the problem. As an added bonus, this particular model of box has particularly course options for splay angle, and the next choice is too narrow for this application.

**Solution 3:** DSP. Tweak the gain and HF shelf on the top box. Except we can't, because we're all on one channel here. Or can we?

These active boxes have a pot on the back that sets the input level to the internal amp. We can tweak that to get some gain back. There's also a per-box option for HF compensation, and we can try our luck with that to see if we can get an HF shelf boost out of it.

As soon as we talk about level shading arrays, audio people get really nervous. The first issue is that once the array is level-shaded, some boxes are going to go into limiting before others. Whether or not this is a problem is heavily dependent on the situation. Typical shading situations involve bringing the bottom few boxes down by a few dB to reduce the extra HF down front. We try to do as much as we can with splay, but generally we still will need a few dB via gain, and this isn't really an issue of limiting because these boxes, in being turned down, now have \*more\* headroom than those pointing at FOH, so there's no problem. It's when the higher gain boxes are further back in the house, like this example, that we need to be more careful. By setting the gain higher on the top box than for the rest, we have a situation where the top box will hit its limter first and the FOH engineer down in the middle of the house won't hear it. If this is a high-SPL situation (rap, rock, EDM, etc) where the PA is taken to its limits every night (giggity), this is probably something we want to avoid.

However, this is a situation that prioritizes low variance and high intelligibility, and the PA is not operated anywhere even close to its limits. For the types of events staged in this hall, people would be lodging loudness complaints (it's lots of old people, okay?) far before the PA hits its maximum output, so the dynamic range issue isn't a concern, whereas creating a low-variance, high-intelligibility environment for the patrons is definitely a priority for the venue's management.

The other, more common, and far more baseless objection to array shading is that any gain offset between boxes ""breaks the line."" Bob McCarthy has written what I consider to be a [landmark article](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/study_hall/breaking_the_line/) about this which outlines a number of reasons why this concern is unfounded, but I'll address the most commonly stated objection here: that shading down some boxes reduces the array's headroom.

Of course this is true, but in reality the loss is so tiny that it's negligible in all but the most extreme situations. We're talking of course about LF because that's where the boxes have the most overlap and thus the most summation. We have a 4 box array, which means that the LF headroom of the array is 12 dB above that of a single box. That is, 0 dB + 0 dB + 0 dB + 0 dB, which *everyone knows* is 12 dB. No? Here's the same math in linear for for boxes at unity:

    1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Get back to log with

     20log(4/1) = 12 dB

Now let's say we turned one box down by 2 dB. How much LF coupling do we lose?

\-2 dB is about .8 in linear (you've got these memorized, [right](http://gph.is/1TqiIcG)?)

So we now have

    0 dB + 0 dB + 0 dB + (-2 dB)

which in linear is

    1 + 1 + 1 + 0.8 = 3.8

That comes out to 11.6 dB rather than 12. (20log3.8 = 11.6, or use 20log(3.8/4) to get the dB loss in relative terms as compared to the no-shading situation)

In a situation that demands low variance, a half a dB in LF headroom is a small price to pay for reducing front-back variance by 2 dB. For the same reason, I'm not concerned about goosing the top box by a dB or two.

Also for the same reason, bringing up the gain on the top box (or down on the rest, if you like) isn't going to cause a significant effect at LF, where all the boxes are working together. It will, however, help increasingly above 1k, which is where our problem is. With one ""pot notch"" (whatever that is) of gain and the HF ""coupling compensation"" onboard DSP filter engaged, here's what we get:

[https://imgur.com/eBkQ5qd](https://imgur.com/eBkQ5qd)

&amp;#x200B;

If you compare that to the [first image](https://imgur.com/lnmdewq), you can see that we actually overshot a bit: the back seats are leading the rest of the array in the HF by about 3 db above 1 kHz. Given those two options, I certainly choose the latter. The intelligibility in the rear is greatly improved over the original state. In addition, I'll take an extra dB or two in the back simply because of the stage sound down front. What we have here is a PA that does not get louder as you get closer to it, and a high degree of confidence that whatever the FOH engineer mixes will be heard in all the seats, which those with touring experience can confirm is a relative rarity in venues of this size. Even with limited options on the table, a small change here and there goes a long way.

As always, comments, questions, and alternate approaches are welcomed. Wishing you all a wonderful holiday season.

Now let's say we turned one box down by 2 dB. How much LF coupling do we lose?

\-2 dB is about .8 in linear (you've got these memorized, [right](http://gph.is/1TqiIcG)?)

So we now have

    0 dB + 0 dB + 0 dB + (-2 dB)

which in linear is

    1 + 1 + 1 + 0.8 = 3.8

That comes out to 11.6 dB rather than 12. (20log3.8 = 11.6, or use 20log(3.8/4) to get the dB loss in relative terms as compared to the no-shading situation)

In a situation that demands low variance, a half a dB in LF headroom is a small price to pay for reducing front-back variance by 2 dB. For the same reason, I'm not concerned about goosing the top box by a dB or two.

Also for the same reason, bringing up the gain on the top box (or down on the rest, if you like) isn't going to cause a significant effect at LF, where all the boxes are working together. It will, however, help increasingly above 1k, which is where our problem is. With one ""pot notch"" (whatever that is) of gain and the HF ""coupling compensation"" onboard DSP filter engaged, here's what we get:

&amp;#x200B;

If you compare that to the [first image](https://imgur.com/lnmdewq), you can see that we actually overshot a bit: the back seats are leading the rest of the array in the HF by about 3 db above 1 kHz. Given those two options, I certainly choose the latter. The intelligibility in the rear is greatly improved over the original state. In addition, I'll take an extra dB or two in the back simply because of the stage sound down front. What we have here is a PA that does not get louder as you get closer to it, and a high degree of confidence that whatever the FOH engineer mixes will be heard in all the seats, which those with touring experience can confirm is a relative rarity in venues of this size. Even with limited options on the table, a small change here and there goes a long way.

As always, comments, questions, and alternate approaches are welcomed. Wishing you all a wonderful holiday season.

Yet another Comm(post),"Hey folks, first off I'm a video engineer not an audio engineer, so please be gentle... and while we're on the subject of comm, just want to say how grateful all us vidiots are that the task of comm often falls on your shoulders and what a *wonderful job* y'all do. Thank you!

Ok, so obligatory salutations out of the way, I haz a question. (and I've done a cursory search of past posts and not quite sure I've found what I'm looking for)

I'd like to experiment a bit with setting up bi-directional communication between a party line system like Clearcom or RTS, and a low latency strictly LAN VOIP solution like Teamspeak or Mumble.

Why buy expensive stuff?,"Recently, I was having a whimsical ""what would you do with a million dollars"" conversation with my wife.

Community Theater rig... looking for ideas,"I've put together a small rig for the community theater here and am looking for ideas on ways to improve it.

&amp;#x200B;

1. X-Air XR18
2. 7x Shure Dual wireless Mic packs
3. DriveRack 360 (with RTA mic)
4. Laptop - usually my macbook air soon to add a PC for others to use.
5. Scarlett 2i2 USB DAC (normally stolen from my desk)
6. Stream Deck - surprisingly awesome for shows.
7. In the main venue, I've added some Shure hanging Lavs
8. My spare mixer - Bheringer X1222USB
9. Wireless router since the x-air built-in is a bit lame
10. X-Touch
11. Fire 10 tablet, Fire 7 tablet, phone, whatever is handy to run around the theater with. The 10 is my goto for tuning.
12. LED strip light with a dimmer on a 1x2 that I run across the entire sound table. Goosenecks be gone.
13. (Usually) Yamaha DBR12s for stage monitors. Small Bheringer for backstage monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

The X-Air is a great rig, but I have to admit that I'm considering getting them an X32. When I spec'd the 18, I never envisioned needing 14 friggin wireless mics. They still end up swapping packs around.

So a surprise entry here is the Stream Deck. I honestly bought this on a whim for my gaming rig. Helping out for one show I brought it along. It turns out that the thing is fantastic for audio cues. I'm even tempted to run one over to the director so they can kick off sound effects. Each clip is assigned a button and you can quickly build multiple screens. For the last show there were 45 audio cues. We were able to nail them all easily with the stream deck.

The hanging Lavs have saved us more times than I can count. Unfortunately there's a projector setup in center stage and I can't hang mics there.

I have mics, mixer and driverack mounted in an odyssey FZ1004 10u/4u slant case. It's really heavy despite being loaded with relatively lightweight gear. (And a pair of furman power strips to plug everything in.) Is there a good lightweight option? Setup is much easier despite the weight. Usually it's just a matter of hijacking some cables to run monitor/stage feeds (I use the house wiring and couplers to reverse the xlr flow) and I takeover the master output from the house board. (The house board has some issues so I avoid slaving into it anymore)

&amp;#x200B;

Things I'd love suggestions on:

Lightweight rack options. The case I've been using is a bit painful to haul around. I may just put casters on it and call it a day.

Good ways to extend the X-touch for live shows. The sliders are great but without some midi software controls the buttons on the right are just pretty lights. It seems that I can dual use it as x-air control and then pull midi data via the usb interface at the same time...

Good ways to general Mic center stage. I've considered 1-2 crown PCC-160s or maybe some stand mounted 'choir' mics - aka Lavs on a stick.

Question regarding multiple volume controls and how to set them,"I have the XR-18, which I love, although it's taught me that I really need to learn more about sound engineering. One particular issue I need to tackle comes from a use case I have, namely using it as a glorified headphone amp.

For my live shows, I intend to take the various IEM feeds from FOH and plug them all into the XR-18. Then, each aux out will go to a performer. It might seem like an extra step but I believe it's justified - FOH doesn't have to solve any puzzles of getting a feed to everyone across the stage, and people can share monitor mixes if there aren't enough auxes. (Happens a lot, sadly.)

Where I get stuck is how I should set levels for these incoming feeds. There are so many places where the volume is potentially affected:

1. How much FOH puts in their aux send

2. How much gain there is on the channel that feed is going into in the XR-18

3. The channel fader level in the XR-18

4. The aux mix fader level in the XR-18 

5. The input gain on the wireless IEM system's transmitter

6. The volume control on the receiver

That's a lot of steps! I want to make sure, assuming FOH sends a strong signal with no clipping, that I can retain that strength all the way to the band's IEMs. Any advice would be most appreciated :)",t2_4g0ide,2,1,"Question regarding multiple volume controls and how to set them I have the XR-18, which I love, although it's taught me that I really need to learn more about sound engineering.

Best Mic for Quiet Vocalist?,"Hey everyone, i'm wondering what mics have worked best for a quiet vocalist in a loud band. The singer in my band has a very soft voice with a lot of reverb on it. We recently switched her to a IEM setup which has helped a ton with stage feedback issues. The issue we are facing now is cymbal bleed into the mic. We are mostly playing small club size stages so regardless of the vocal placement it's always relatively close to the drums. Our tech last night said that the vocal reverb was hitting the drums super hard and also the drums were bleeding into the IEM mix a lot.  


I know some sort of hyper cardioid pickup mic would work best but i'm wondering what experience people have with each one. We have used a Beta 57 time to time but have found the output too hot and highs a little harsh.

IEMs with Orchestra,"Hey all,

Got a show coming up where I'll be doing some IEM work for a few performers who are being accompanied by a small orchestra and choir. There will be main orchestra mic arrays (probably spaced pair and some outriggers), and spot mics buried within the orchestra.

Usually for orchestral mixes I will delay spot mics to the main array. I'm concerned this technique won't translate to IEMs because of the positioning of the performers with IEMs (likely somewhere nestled around/in the orchestra/choir), and the potential for the performer's voice/instrument to bleed into the spot mics that are close to them. These performers also have a tendency to only wear one ear of their IEM as well. 


How would you monitor engineers attack this? Ditch trying to use the orchestral spot mics at all? Use them but with no delay? Ditch trying to incorporate the main array? ",t2_6cbc7,3,1,"IEMs with Orchestra Hey all,

Router recommendation for XR18,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am am music teacher at an elementary school and we put on musicals each year. As the main sound person, I've been slowly improving our sound situation and at the recommendation of some sound tech friends (and due to budget), I went with the XR18. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight was the first show for parents. All week it had been working fine, though like an idiot I was just connected directly to the unit without a router. And of course, like all the posts and reviews say, tonight about 10 minutes after opening house and the room filling up, connection was lost. Even standing right next to it we couldn't get connected. Not with PC or ipad. Had to scramble but made things work. We have our second show tomorrow night. 

&amp;#x200B;

So tomorrow I get to buy what I need for the show that night. Can you guys tell me of some appropriate routers I can get at my local Best Buy that will work fine in a cafeteria of 300 people.  Hopefully not break the bank too much but PTA should reimburse me some. I'm also an idiot and couldn't get it hard wired, but if getting 200 ft of cat-5 or cat-6 will be a good backup plan I will do that as well.

Looking for advice on a setup for a live perfomance in a not so great environment,"Hey guys!

&amp;#x200B;

I was tasked with setting up the gear for a live gig my band is going to do. 

The problem is that we're gonna play in the front of one of our friend's house, in a little recess in front of the garage door.

Our band has three vocals (one main, two backing), eletric guitar and keys (or two guitars, the keyboardist plays rhythm guitar in a couple of songs), bass and drums. 

We have three 150w PA's (connect to the mixer), two 100w guitar amps (both with stands) and one 80w bass amp.

Even though we will have the walls on the sides and back, I'm worried that the open sky and also the front will make everything sound thin and small.

How can I setup this gear so we can have the most presence and compete with the cars passing on the street?

Weird Freespeak II beltpack issue,"I'm currently A2-ing a show right now: I have 7 beltpacks and 1 freespeak II base station.

I went into the menus on a working beltpack and found that the Auto Detect function was off. Changing this to off on the non working beltpack (it was ON) fixed the issue. Turning Auto Detect on my working pack to ON, and then cycling the power, made the belt pack not pass audio.

How do I practice?,"I've been fortunate in the past to work with a band that had a kick ass practice space where I could do a full show setup using all the equipment we'd usually use at shows, but due to ""issues"" we've had to move to a much smaller shared space. In this space, the band I work with isn't the main band using the place, so I'm unable to use our normal setup or board, or make any major changes to the board or PA.  It's an older analog board, so I don't have the benefit of scenes or anything. We basically only run vocals through it.

The old setup allowed me to play around with the board and try things without the risk of ruining a live show. I learn best by actually putting my fingers on knobs and sliders, so this is pretty important to me. Ever since moving to the new studio I feel like my skills have stagnated. 

I'm pretty green, but I'm at the point where I can consistently get sound that's ""non broken"" (can hear everyone, no/little feedback etc) but I know I can get things to sound a lot better.  

I also have several live shows recorded. Unfortunately, theres not a lot I can do with those other than loading them up in a DAW and trying to get a good mix out of them. That's valuable for playing with things like EQ, compression, effects etc, but not really comparable to a live show.

What else should I be looking at practice-wise? I suspect I was spoiled before with our old setup. I really wish I had tried more things while we were still there.

Speaker recommendations for a jazz venue,"Hey all, looking for some recommendations for a PA system for the venue I manage.

We're a 1200sq ft, [extremely oddly shaped room](https://imgur.com/a/nJSbFML). Our venue exclusively presents jazz, mostly modern stuff. Since the room is small enough, the acoustic level of the drums really dictates what we throw in the PA, which is usually piano and voice, and occasionally horns that aren't way too loud. Our room is sort of treated so there isn't stuff bouncing around all over the place, but definitely still a live + kind of boomy room. 

Our current system is a pair of Mackie SA1530z. The issue I encounter is how the sound of the room changes based on where you're sitting. In the middle area of the room, up to where the mixer is, there's a raised roof that goes up about 24 feet. The room is at it's regular height at the stage and behind the mixer, which is 14 feet. As you might guess, the change in roof size affect the sound and things sound different on stage, vs right in front of the stage, vs, all the way behind the mixer. Additionally, the room also gets tinier (as in like an L shape), so you really don't get much of the stage right speaker in the back of the room. 

My first thought is that the Mackies are raised at the 14 feet height of the ceiling, so hanging at about 11-12 feet, and are pointed straight, which affects the people at the front of the room sitting sort of underneath the speaker, they don't get as much of it as someone sitting in the back. As I mentioned, the room is treated, but the shape of the room is really hard to fight so there's only so much the treatment can do for us. So for now I'd like to solve the speaker issue and see if there's any better options available. For a 1200sq ft room, two 1300watt speakers are a bit much, I think, although I can't seem to find anything smaller than that that is also 3-way. 

So my first question/assumption is, changing the way my current Mackies are mounted, by aiming them a bit more down, would that help the distribution of sound?

My second question is, are there any speakers that may be better suited for the job? For a second I was thinking about doing a faux-vertical array with 4 speakers, 2 on each side, one pair pointing straight ahead and one pair pointing down more, but maybe there's a single pair of speakers that may do the trick without having to work on an array. I should mention my budget for this is ~$2000 (hopefully less).

Obviously changing the mounting on my current speakers would be the cheapest option, probably not running me any more than $1000 for the parts and labor, but speakers I've been looking at have been $1000+ each.

MR18 vs X32R,"Hi All,
I've searched through almost all discussion on the MR18, X32R, and the closely related XR18 on this sub--but I still have some questions that hopefully you all can help me out with.

I am a hobbyist, and would be looking to only use this mixer for small ensembles (mostly 6-10 vocalists on handhelds) as well as for my primary interface for recording.  

It seems to me like most of the arguments for the X32R are that it is a more effective mixer at adapting to large scale gigs, and interfaces well with the other x32 products.

On the other hand, the MR18 is smaller, and has the midas preamps.  I haven't had the chance to play with either, but I'm under the impression that this would give the MR18 a better sound--is this true?

Are there any other major factors I should consider? Effect/app differences? The two are at a fairly close price point, so I'm just trying to get the most bang for my buck for my use case.

I've searched through almost all discussion on the MR18, X32R, and the closely related XR18 on this sub--but I still have some questions that hopefully you all can help me out with.

I am a hobbyist, and would be looking to only use this mixer for small ensembles (mostly 6-10 vocalists on handhelds) as well as for my primary interface for recording.  

It seems to me like most of the arguments for the X32R are that it is a more effective mixer at adapting to large scale gigs, and interfaces well with the other x32 products.

On the other hand, the MR18 is smaller, and has the midas preamps.  I haven't had the chance to play with either, but I'm under the impression that this would give the MR18 a better sound--is this true?

Are there any other major factors I should consider? Effect/app differences? The two are at a fairly close price point, so I'm just trying to get the most bang for my buck for my use case.

Thanks for any help you can offer!"
Mixing with earplugs,"So I know this debate has been had many times but I’m currently studying sound Technology at uni and have done my first couple of gigs as foh but struggle to mix with ear plugs in at the moment and keep having to switch between having them in and out but I don’t feel comfortable doing this for too long. Has anyone got any tips for how to get used to mixing with earplugs in, they’re not quite a flat frequency response but they’re near enough.

"From band to solo, trying to achieve stereo lofi sound - looking for mixer and need advice","Howdy

So my band disintegrated and I got offered to play a show within the next few weeks. I want to run a mic into my fx board (stereo out) and recorded instrumentals into a mixer and out into a Roland JC and a bass amp. I also have a fender passport as an option 

I play lofi vinyl tropical Esque music and my sound is dependent on vocals in stereo - one channel dry other channel completely wet (delay). I’ve been using my tascam 424 mkii as a mixer and I love the natural hiss but I don’t want to risk anything happening to it live. I would be v appreciative to any suggestions to an alternative mixer (up to 6-8 channels for future use as ideally within $200-300) and also any thoughts on my rig or if you have had experiences with a similar set up.

Help/Advice determining if Audio Equipment is ample for Venue.,"Hello.

I am currently organizing a concert event with a semi-notable rapper and am trying to gauge if the audio equipment that is being provided by the production company will be enough for the venue. First, I think it is important to note that the production for the event is being coordinated by the rapper's manager and is being rolled into the overall booking cost of the artist. This leads me to believe that they would be motivated to skimp on production costs and supply subpar equipment, as it would mean more money for them. I have no serious knowledge of audio equipment on this scale, so I am enlisting your help to make an educated decision.

**Venue Details:** We are expecting 1500-2000 people for this event. The performance will take place inside a 2,000 sq ft basement (concrete floor and walls). The basement opens up to a 1-acre outside area. 2 large windows and 2 double doors on the exterior wall will be removed to allow for sight and audibility of the performance to those outside. 

**Production Details (they are valuing at $2500) :**

* Behringer X32 (Quantity: 1)
* Behringer S16 (Quantity: 3)
* Shure ULX-D Wireless (Quantity: 3)
* EV ETX 15P (Mains) (Quantity: 6)
* EV ETX 18SP (Subs) (Quantity: 2)
* QSC HPR 122i DJ Monitor (Quantity: 1)
* Speaker Stand (Quantity: 6)
* Mic Stands (Quantity: 2)
* Audio Cable Kit (Quantity: 1)
* Audio Power Cable Kit (Quantity: 1)
* LABOR: Audio Engineer 1(Quantity: 1)
* LABOR: Stage Hands (Quantity: 2)

**Questions:**

1. Is a value of $2500 fair for this amount of equipment? If not, any suggestions for other production options? (Located in SC)
2. Will this amount of equipment provide ample sound performance, not only inside the basement but to the aprox. 1000 people in the outdoor area? If not, what do I need to ask for to get the performance I am looking for? (Power output is not a problem. We have more than enough.)
3. The absence of lighting equipment is something that is bothering me. If I were to ask for a standard/budget lighting setup for inside the basement, how much should I expect the price to increase?

Traditions concerning turning on orchestra mics for tuning,"Folks working with pits/orchestras regularly, is there an established tradition when it comes to turning on the mics in the pit? Specifically, do you turn on the mics when they start tuning so you can maintain that's what they're going to sound like throughout the show, or do you wait until they're done because that's when the show 'starts'? Granted if your whole pit is in an iso booth then probably not, but for open air pits what is common practice?

Acoustic baffles for misbehaving guitarists?,"Hey guys. Working in small venues as I do, guitar volume is always a problem. Venue I work very closely with is also having all sorts of issues with neighbor complaints, so I need to be able to mix at a lower level. Has anyone used half height plexiglass screens  to control this? Any notes on its effectiveness? Obviously turning the amp down is the first port of call, but if the show has started and the guitarist turns up, often I can't even get on stage to turn it down. At least having it out of the rest of the mics means I can control it and not have to ramp the vocals up to compensate when they do.   


Additionally, is plexiglass even the best material? Could a sheet of toughened glass coated by rockwool work even better?

Thoughts on Bose's RoomMatch arrays? Just wrapped our shiny new install,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/2t9B8Hp](https://imgur.com/gallery/2t9B8Hp)

I'm really impressed by this system, and I normally hate Bose Professional PAs. This lineup seems great though, because it's based on physical box design, and maximum number of box angle options, rather than digital steering mojo and time delay magic. Those seems to be bose's traditional marketing tools. But there's nothing magical about the design or function, just flexible designs made possible by the number of options for elements you can choose. We have an odd shaped room, with little floor space, and we were able to cover the entire room, including flying the 2x18 sub, from front row to back of the balcony with a single array, no delay fills, and minimal sound directed outside the seating area. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reflections are much less pronounced, sound is clear and full, very even coverage thanks to the single hang, transition between boxes is smooth, and directional control seems very nicely implemented.

Anyone know of a multi input mixer that is incredibly simple to use?,"So we have a fairly simple little powered mixer that is in the youth area at our church.  You would think that this would be something people could handle. However, every time I use it, the inputs are all out of whack, inputs clipping, eq turned all the way down, etc. 

Is there a mixer with 4-8 channels that has a digital interface with no knobs or hidden knobs so the settings could be locked?  Also, something with auto gain control might be nice for when they crank the computer output to 11. 

Right now this is accessible to a wide range of parent volunteers and high school students. Something with a simple volume control would be best.

Podcast monitoring,"I hope this is the right place for this...

I have several friends that want to get together on a freeform podcast project and record random crap for two hours or so.  As a proof of concept, we want to try a few of them and see how they are received.  We don't want to invest thousands into a bunch of high-end audio gear (that none of us know how to use) if we don't have to.  I would like some suggestions on how to pull this off given the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1- I plan on capturing a muti-track using Adobe Audition on my macbook pro with 3 to 5 people sitting around just shooting the crap.  I will route all audio through a thuderbolt USB hub.

2- We are going to start with entry level microphones, probably the Audio-Technica AT2005USB.  

3- One of the biggest issues is this: I don't know how to get everyone monitoring the multichannel mix.  I have done some pretty simple google searches, but I am having no luck with it at all.  

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I know that the majority of folks in here are pros and will curse this idea as amateur and not worthy of their time, I am just hoping that someone can give me some direction and advice to make a low budget audio engagement sound decent while allowing everyone to monitor the multichannel mix down in real time so that we are not all stepping on each other during the conversation.

 Normally use stapass 500 for my gigs (acoustic duo) but playing in a larger venue this weekend. 

Hoping to use the mg16 with two dbr10s as main speakers and stagepass speakers as our monitors. 

Have the new Yamaha desk a few months but never gave it the time to get used to it as the stagepass is normally more than enough in the pubs we play. 

Kind of panicking now so any help will be greatly appreciated."
Lightsaber handle looking wireless access point/router?,I’ve seen guys on multiple tours setup a wireless access point or router that looks like a lightsaber handle almost.

Subtractive EQ vs additive and subtractive EQ.,"I have a studio background, but currently work as an audio guy.

Because of my studio background, My coworkers keep giving me a hard time when I EQ. 

At some points I boost and cut at the same time, and it sounds good, especially when it’s A/B’d, but everyone keeps telling me I shouldn’t be boosting at all. Only cutting frequencies, but I’ve never heard that. 

I think my confusion comes from learning mostly in a studio environment, where it’s fine to boost frequencies, but now getting into live sound is where I run into people giving me a hard time about my EQ. If it sounds fine, why wouldn’t I boost frequencies? Can someone clear this up for me? ",t2_2jh28i2i,8,1,"Subtractive EQ vs additive and subtractive EQ.

X32 Complete Backup,"I can't believe it's been 6.5 years since the X32 dropped, but yep, it's true - and somehow I've *never* touched one. But here I am, with a suitcase gig looming on the horizon.

The regular house engineer isn't the most technically proficient dude, but he's comfortable in his own skin. I want to take care to leave the console the same way I found it.

My question is --- *how do you completely backup and restore an X32*? I'm talking everything from A-to-Z, including any shows, scenes, snippets, presets, etc which are saved inside the console.

Assume it's running on older firmware as the regular guy doesn't strike me as the kind to make updates. I might try to talk him into it ... we'll see.

Thank you, /r/livesound

Looking for recommendations on a portable PA for an assortment of college events around campus!,"Good afternoon all, 

Looking to create a portable PA system for a campus tech team to supply all needs for a multitude of events. These events may include some worship nights with smaller bands, providing a microphone and music for events ranging from 100-500 people. 

This is what I'm currently looking at

2 x K12.2a 

1 x KW181

1x X-Air

2 x Schure GLXD24/B87A

In addition to that, I'll get a supply of XLRs to run everything to and fro. My main concern is that the X-Air might be overkill and I should be looking at something more similar to Behringer Xenyx 1002b Mixer. 

I also want to dual mount the K12s to the sub, but in my research of it, it seems that they are too big to do that, but I wanted to see if y'all had different opinions. 

More than open to completely different solutions too, thanks! ",t2_jmhtx,1,1,"Looking for recommendations on a portable PA for an assortment of college events around campus! Good afternoon all,

Experience with Sennheiser e602-II and e902 microphones,"Hi, I just noticed the discount Sennheiser is having on the e602-II microphone and was wondering what your experiences are with it.

I only used the original one and loved it's deep and tight sound. Especially compared to the Beta 52a I typically use.

Is the mark two version comparable? And what about the e902 model? I like most of the 900 series a lot, but haven't tried that model yet.",t2_3y53h02,1,1,"Experience with Sennheiser e602-II and e902 microphones Hi, I just noticed the discount Sennheiser is having on the e602-II microphone and was wondering what your experiences are with it.
