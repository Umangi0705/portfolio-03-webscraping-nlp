1901,mic' a choir on a footbal field with a  person march band behind them hello  titl say it all i'm struggl to come up with the best way to do thi as there are current two school of thought on my team and i thought i'd get a third opinion thi saturday my colleg march band ha one of our choir join us on field for out halftim show and we realli aren't sure the best way to mic them they'll be stand in sever tight arc no more than  yard across one the front sidelin with a third of the band to their left and right and the last third mostli trumpet and the drumlin behind them my biggest concern is block the sound of the band and the drumlin from behind them my initi idea wa to put two or three small diagraph mic in front of them thi way we could use their bodi as a shield to absorb as much of the sound as possibl from behind them downsid is that we won't catch as mani peopl in the back the second idea is to use two boom hang over them point down but the closest thing my depart ha to a boom mic is the shure sm57 is that direct enough to not pick up sound come from the band behind and i guess the third idea a priori is some combin of both ani insight on thi thi is my first time mic' a choir and the challeng of find someth that work in a live set with a march band behind them is realli throw me off so ani insight would be appreci post game updat we had our rehears friday with the choir and our biggest issu wa feedback we initi had   out but cut it down to  after the feedback issu their final posit wa a littl below chest height point ever so slightli upward there were no problem when the band wa play quietli but as soon as they start to step on the ga we were hit major feedback veri quickli we pinpoint the feedback to surpris the drumlin and specif bass  wa tune to the same pitch that kept amplifi itself so we took that bass out of the show and eq'd out as much of the bass as possibl on our mixer overal everyth work there were onli a coupl moment dure the show feedback start to creep in but we kept it all under control look back i realli wish i had a drum shield will probabl make thi invest the next time we have a choir and an equal i'v been look at the behring fbq3102hd graphic equal anyway so we'll probabl add thi to our arsen soon thank you all for your help and suggest,mic'ing a choir on a football field with a  person marching band behind them hello  title say it all i'm struggling to come up with the best way to do this a there are currently two school of thought on my team and i thought i'd get a third opinion this saturday my college marching band ha one of our choir joining u on field for out halftime show and we really aren't sure the best way to mic them they'll be standing in several tight arc no more than  yard across one the front sideline with a third of the band to their left and right and the last third mostly trumpet and the drumline behind them my biggest concern is blocking the sound of the band and the drumline from behind them my initial idea wa to put two or three small diagraph mics in front of them this way we could use their body a a shield to absorb a much of the sound a possible from behind them downside is that we won't catch a many people in the back the second idea is to use two boom hanging over them pointed down but the closest thing my department ha to a boom mic is the shure sm57 is that directional enough to not pick up sound coming from the band behind and i guess the third idea a priori is some combination of both any insight on this this is my first time mic'ing a choir and the challenge of finding something that work in a live setting with a marching band behind them is really throwing me off so any insight would be appreciated post game update we had our rehearsal friday with the choir and our biggest issue wa feedback we initially had   out but cut it down to  after the feedback issue their final position wa a little below chest height pointed ever so slightly upwards there were no problem when the band wa playing quietly but a soon a they started to step on the gas we were hitting major feedback very quickly we pinpointed the feedback to surprise the drumline and specifically bass  wa tuned to the same pitch that kept amplifying itself so we took that bass out of the show and eq'd out a much of the bass a possible on our mixer overall everything worked there were only a couple moment during the show feedback started to creep in but we kept it all under control looking back i really wish i had a drum shield will probably make this investment the next time we have a choir and an equalizer i've been looking at the behringer fbq3102hd graphic equalizer anyways so we'll probably add this to our arsenal soon thank you all for your help and suggestion

707,logic pro parallel process latenc issu resolv sort of hi there i want to share with you a discoveri i found while do parallel process in logic pro  which i have a suspicion may still appli to logic  and x problem wa that one of the main group buss wa lag by about  or so than the rest of my main buss everi channel wa sent to one of  main group buss  drum  instrument pump with a sidechain  instrument i want no pump  bass and  wobbl fx buss all were output to output   except for wobbl buss and reverb buss which were both rout back to the instrument buss with sidechain and thi rout is exactli what wa caus the problem i wa abl to test thi by send a snare hit to the buss in question while simultan send to one of the other buss also test with main out and you would hear it slap twice i wa fear that perhap new york compress and other parallel process techniqu might encount issu in logic pro with latenc issu due to some architectur 'error' howev with a littl experiment i wa abl to allevi the problem the short short summari is that it seem logic may have issu with multipl aux output to eachoth rather than when they all output directli to output   aux1 instrument were sent to thi buss for process with an lfo to perform a 'wobble' filter effect serum fx gt onli send wa to aux2 for reverb and output to aux3 main instrument pump buss serum fx had a side chain input activ aux2 wave rverb gt output to aux3 main instrument pump buss aux3 main instrument buss with ssl buss compressor sidechain to a kick drum captur from aux  aux  wa lag by the  or so ms compar to the other aux/buss group latenc wa set to all in logic pro set so in theori compens should have been all in align but check thi out when i remov aux1' reverb send the latenc disappear likewis when i chang the output from the reverb buss aux2 from aux  to output   the latenc would also go away i should note when i would remov all plugin from the reverb aux thi had no effect on latenc if still output to aux  so we might conclud that there wa someth about two separ aux channel wobbl buss and reverb buss feed into a common  aux creat delay compens issu with that particular aux channel but there more to the stori if i remov the sidechain from serum fx on aux1 the latenc disappear it didn't matter what wa go on with the reverb aux so i thought mayb thi wa all due to a flaw with serum i remov serum ad an ssl compressor to the same aux channel aux1 latenc still gone but then i ad a sidechain to the compressor and guess what latenc back and i could perform the same experi abov with the reverb channel so there wa someth about have a sidechain aux and it send ultim meet at a final common aux that will caus it to experi faulti delay compens remov either the sidechain or chang the send rout and the problem goe away weird right anyon want to chime in on what might be happen here interestingli i have not been abl to recreat thi experi all the time it seem to happen at random if i were to take a stab at what' go on here i think it ha someth to do with how the busses/aux are rout intern with logic when they are establish initi and how it relat to the delay compens algorithm perhap it depend on the order of when they are establish rout to eachoth or when the plugin are ad the list could go on and on so i would suggest be awar that these problem may happen in logic when aux are be sent to other aux and there is some sidechan go on not a common issu or scenario i'm sure but still someth to bear in mind hope thi wasn't too convolut but i invit you to repeat the experi and see if you can come up with anyth,logic pro parallel processing latency issue resolved sort of hi there i wanted to share with you a discovery i found while doing parallel processing in logic pro  which i have a suspicion may still apply to logic  and x problem wa that one of the main group bus wa lagged by about  or so than the rest of my main bus every channel wa sent to one of  main group bus  drum  instrument pumped with a sidechain  instrument i wanted no pump  bass and  wobble fx bus all were outputting to output   except for wobble bus and reverb bus which were both routed back to the instrument bus with sidechain and this routing is exactly what wa causing the problem i wa able to test this by sending a snare hit to the bus in question while simultaneously sending to one of the other bus also tested with main out and you would hear it slap twice i wa fearing that perhaps new york compression and other parallel processing technique might encounter issue in logic pro with latency issue due to some architectural 'error' however with a little experimentation i wa able to alleviate the problem the short short summary is that it seems logic may have issue with multiple auxes outputting to eachother rather than when they all output directly to output   aux1 instrument were sent to this bus for processing with an lfo to perform a 'wobble' filter effect serum fx gt only send wa to aux2 for reverb and outputted to aux3 main instrumentation pump bus serum fx had a side chain input activated aux2 wave rverb gt outputted to aux3 main instrument pump bus aux3 main instrument bus with ssl bus compressor sidechained to a kick drum captured from aux  aux  wa lagging by the  or so m compared to the other aux/buss group latency wa set to all in logic pro setting so in theory compensation should have been all in alignment but check this out when i removed aux1's reverb send the latency disappeared likewise when i changed the output from the reverb bus aux2 from aux  to output   the latency would also go away i should note when i would remove all plugins from the reverb aux this had no effect on latency if still outputting to aux  so we might conclude that there wa something about two separate aux channel wobble bus and reverb bus feeding into a common  aux creating delay compensation issue with that particular aux channel but there more to the story if i removed the sidechain from serum fx on aux1 the latency disappeared it didn't matter what wa going on with the reverb aux so i thought maybe this wa all due to a flaw with serum i removed serum added an ssl compressor to the same aux channel aux1 latency still gone but then i added a sidechain to the compressor and guess what latency back and i could perform the same experiment above with the reverb channel so there wa something about having a sidechained aux and it send ultimately meeting at a final common aux that will cause it to experience faulty delay compensation remove either the sidechain or change the send routing and the problem go away weird right anyone want to chime in on what might be happening here interestingly i have not been able to recreate this experiment all the time it seems to happen at random if i were to take a stab at what's going on here i think it ha something to do with how the busses/auxes are routed internally with logic when they are established initially and how it relates to the delay compensation algorithm perhaps it depends on the order of when they are established routed to eachother or when the plugins are added the list could go on and on so i would suggest being aware that these problem may happen in logic when auxes are being sent to other auxes and there is some sidechaning going on not a common issue or scenario i'm sure but still something to bear in mind hopefully this wasn't too convoluted but i invite you to repeat the experiment and see if you can come up with anything

thi issu i'v notic that variou player with realli big guitar sound like adam jone of tool have multi amp setup even guy like zakk wyld use a choru pedal with multipl amp to thicken their sound at the moment i have a boss dd  delay with stereo out and i'm look to add a boss choru pedal and boss reverb pedal with stereo out as well what i'd like to go for is an a/b/i setup so i have the option of run two amp simultan dure live perform i actual would even be interest in run three amp simultan if possibl though thi isn't absolut necessari if a three way splitter is insan expens compar to a two way a/b/i one i'm fine with stick to the two way one haul two amp to a show would probabl be enough work as it is i'v read how on album like siames dream multi tracking/lay guitar part wa a huge part of get that monstrou tone which got me think that if i rig up two or three amp to use all at onc while play live or while record i might be abl to sort of approxim that effect adam jone of tool use three amp with each one focus on handl a differ chunk of the frequenc rang or configur to creat a differ tonal gt so i ve alway play with two or three amp one for high end one that s good with midrang and one that kick in with the low or i use one that s got that good solid state metallica crunch and one that s got that warm marshal tube sound   guitarworld com/gw archive/dear guitar hero adam jone tool talk tone gear video band anonym time between album and more of cours in my case what i'm go for won't be anywher near the corgan esqu wall of sound deriv from stack  or  guitar track all at onc but have two amp go at onc is still a  increas in guitar it might also make record multipl guitar track easier and give me an interest way to get tonal varieti from record the same guitar part i could have two amp go at onc have them both mice up but have them configur differ so that while i'm play one guitar part two differ guitar tone would be gener and record and thi variat in tone could result from differ amp set or simpli by virtu of use say a solid state amp alongsid a tube amp question re splitter box and hum i have done some research and it seem that a splitter that elimin ground hum is vital   premierguitar com/articles/tone_stacking_with_two_amp   seymourduncan com/blog/th tone garage/multi amp rig  but i don't know anyth about thi kind of gadget i e what brand make them what price rang they usual fall in what featur to look for who make decent one that aren't crazi expens etc i'v never tri to rig up anyth thi complex are there ani a/b/i splitter box that are of decent/solid qualiti that effect elimin hum issu without be ultra expens it would be cool to run three amp at onc but if such a box is prohibit expens two amp is fine question re mice these amp dure live show and record also i wa wonder if you guy might have some input on way to mic these two amp dure live show and at home in my adam jone research i found thi inform from one of tool' engin say he would use two mic on each of jones' amp gt adam mainli run three amp he ha a marshal that he love a diezel and then he wa use a mesa boogi at one point i brought in a bogner uberschal head and a rivera knucklehead reverb and sever other thing then we just experi with combin of head and cabinet until it work for the song most of the   were mesa boogi cabinet which are superior for their low end except for the marshal head which went through a marshal cabinet and the rivera went through a rivera cabinet i usual use stock mike for me that' a shure sm57 and a sennheis  on everi cabinet the third mic could be anyth that i felt the sound need more of   guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jone tool guitar rig/ do you guy similarli recommend a combo mic setup of an sm57 and a sennheis  at the moment i just have one sm57 and three sm58 but at some point i might be open to get other mic what doe the  do that is differ from the sm57 would it make a differ in my sound while play live or just be too much unnecessari work for the sound guy question re captur three discret guitar track from three amp simultan in one take thi question might be too focus on record to be includ here so feel free to skip it i just thought i should includ it anyway sinc it is the last element i'd need to cover i have a veri basic behring xenyx   channel mixer with a separ uca  rca to usb interfac that goe into my comput i'd be interest in be abl to captur separ track simultan by individu mice differ guitar amp while i play a singl take and run these mic cabl into separ channel on a mixer thi interview about adam jone' record techniqu explain what i mean gt the signal chain for track guitar wa a bit complex adam would play into whatev pedal he need barresi say that signal then went into a systemat system splitter then it would go to between three and five head the signal from the head went to their own individu cabinet each cabinet had two or three microphon on it then all the microphon came back to the consol and they were blend down as separ for each amp the diezel amp went to it own track the marshal amp went to it own track the third track wa a blend of the bogner and the rivera or whatev i like for the song and that would be one take three track of guitar   guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jone tool guitar rig/ in my case the problem is that when i run two or three or four mic into my mixer then out into the separ rca/usb interfac and into audac on my comput that everyth will just get mix down into one singl track is there ani way to have a mixer simultan record to multipl discret track on a comput program is the issu that my mixer doesn't have a usb output built in would i be abl to lay down multipl discret track all at onc with a differ mixer again no worri if peopl don't want to answer thi last question the other two more directli connect to  wherea thi is tie more to record sorri for the long post but thank in advanc you guy were incred help on my recent post ask about custom earplug for live perform so i realli valu your expertis,looking to build an a/b/y multi guitar amp rig using stereo effect pedal for live performance and recording but am concerned about ground hum anyone have suggestion for gizmo that can split a guitar signal without causing phase or hum problem question re micing this multi amp rig live long post sorry if this is a bit too guitar based of a question to be asked here but it doe concern my hope to set up a working multi amp rig for live performance without causing horrible sounding hum that would annoy an audience and a much a i love /r/guitar i feel like all of you brilliant folk here might have more understanding of the technical end of this issue i've noticed that various player with really big guitar sound like adam jones of tool have multi amp setup even guy like zakk wylde use a chorus pedal with multiple amp to thicken their sound at the moment i have a bos dd  delay with stereo out and i'm looking to add a bos chorus pedal and bos reverb pedal with stereo out a well what i'd like to go for is an a/b/y setup so i have the option of running two amp simultaneously during live performance i actually would even be interested in running three amp simultaneously if possible though this isn't absolutely necessary if a three way splitter is insanely expensive compared to a two way a/b/y one i'm fine with sticking to the two way one hauling two amp to a show would probably be enough work a it is i've read how on album like siamese dream multi tracking/layering guitar part wa a huge part of getting that monstrous tone which got me thinking that if i rigged up two or three amp to use all at once while playing live or while recording i might be able to sort of approximate that effect adam jones of tool us three amp with each one focused on handling a different chunk of the frequency range or configured to create a different tonality gt so i ve always played with two or three amp one for high end one that s good with midrange and one that kick in with the low or i use one that s got that good solid state metallica crunch and one that s got that warm marshall tube sound   guitarworld com/gw archive/dear guitar hero adam jones tool talk tone gear video band anonymity time between album and more of course in my case what i'm going for won't be anywhere near the corgan esque wall of sound derived from stacking  or  guitar track all at once but having two amp going at once is still a  increase in guitar it might also make recording multiple guitar track easier and give me an interesting way to get tonal variety from recording the same guitar part i could have two amp going at once have them both miced up but have them configured differently so that while i'm playing one guitar part two different guitar tone would be generated and recorded and this variation in tone could result from different amp setting or simply by virtue of using say a solid state amp alongside a tube amp question re splitter box and hum i have done some research and it seems that a splitter that eliminates ground hum is vital   premierguitar com/articles/tone_stacking_with_two_amps   seymourduncan com/blog/the tone garage/multi amp rig  but i don't know anything about this kind of gadget i e what brand make them what price range they usually fall in what feature to look for who make decent one that aren't crazy expensive etc i've never tried to rig up anything this complex are there any a/b/y splitter box that are of decent/solid quality that effectively eliminate hum issue without being ultra expensive it would be cool to run three amp at once but if such a box is prohibitively expensive two amp is fine question re micing these amp during live show and recording also i wa wondering if you guy might have some input on way to mic these two amp during live show and at home in my adam jones research i found this information from one of tool's engineer saying he would use two mics on each of jones' amp gt adam mainly run three amp he ha a marshall that he love a diezel and then he wa using a mesa boogie at one point i brought in a bogner uberschall head and a rivera knucklehead reverb and several other thing then we just experimented with combination of head and cabinet until it worked for the song most of the   were mesa boogie cabinet which are superior for their low end except for the marshall head which went through a marshall cabinet and the rivera went through a rivera cabinet i usually used stock miking for me that's a shure sm57 and a sennheiser  on every cabinet the third mic could be anything that i felt the sound needed more of   guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jones tool guitar rig/ do you guy similarly recommend a combo mic setup of an sm57 and a sennheiser  at the moment i just have one sm57 and three sm58s but at some point i might be open to getting other mics what doe the  do that is different from the sm57 would it make a difference in my sound while playing live or just be too much unnecessary work for the sound guy question re capturing three discrete guitar track from three amp simultaneously in one take this question might be too focused on recording to be included here so feel free to skip it i just thought i should include it anyways since it is the last element i'd need to cover i have a very basic behringer xenyx   channel mixer with a separate uca  rca to usb interface that go into my computer i'd be interested in being able to capture separate track simultaneously by individually micing different guitar amp while i play a single take and running these mic cable into separate channel on a mixer this interview about adam jone's recording technique explains what i mean gt the signal chain for tracking guitar wa a bit complex adam would play into whatever pedal he needed barresi say that signal then went into a systematic system splitter then it would go to between three and five head the signal from the head went to their own individual cabinet each cabinet had two or three microphone on it then all the microphone came back to the console and they were blended down a separated for each amp the diezel amp went to it own track the marshall amp went to it own track the third track wa a blend of the bogner and the rivera or whatever i liked for the song and that would be one take three track of guitar   guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jones tool guitar rig/ in my case the problem is that when i run two or three or four mics into my mixer then out into the separate rca/usb interface and into audacity on my computer that everything will just get mixed down into one single track is there any way to have a mixer simultaneously record to multiple discrete track on a computer program is the issue that my mixer doesn't have a usb output built in would i be able to lay down multiple discrete track all at once with a different mixer again no worry if people don't want to answer this last question the other two more directly connect to  whereas this is tied more to recording sorry for the long post but thanks in advance you guy were incredibly helpful on my recent post asking about custom earplug for live performing so i really value your expertise

1146,blue rock hey folk just want to text around and let you know that i feel blue rock in most if not all guis is liter shit i wa work the sound for a gig of it and i wa write some thought down about it with ear plug in and i got into a spot of troubl with an audienc member for it mayb like a soldier scare to fight and i wonder if anybodi had ani thought on how we could erad thi togeth for good to stop futur gener succumb to it and to stop kid have to grow up with it in pub when they have them board outsid say live music but in capit letter whenev i hear someth modern that s perhap got a quick nod to blue rock i realis i think subconsci aww that s cute i onli just realis that i can t process it as music not a snob thing at all it s someth els my brain respond to full blue rock like it s be invad by a mindsuck bacteria no matter how profici the guitar solo or impass the vocal it still get me as a total empti like if pure clich wa a sensat or an energi then blue is the epicentr beyond bore into someth further it show you a  space behind the bore an omni bore but it ha nowher to go it is the blue it s like if you re play wrestl with a friend when you are about ten and then they quickli shock you by pull out a choke hold and squeez your neck in real quick and it feel realli danger and then they go back to play and say gotchya in a nice voic that s like my first exposur to the blue it s like my neck is a littl bit crush so the choke hold can t squeez it right anymor but the hold is in place anyway so i tri and hold myself togeth and get through it the justif for it is that old blue lead to rock n roll i think that thi might be propaganda and even though the evid is there buri within the chord and voic and occasion digga digga that is no reason to trust histori to the extent that we perpetu thi as a reason to give it rever no i say much of my own music can sound like annoy rubbish but noth is like blue rock i think we should have a discuss with each other about how we can best broach a potenti decommiss to leav it to the few player that realli seem to be abl to play blue and make it have someth mayb there could be a licens or someth you can get i m not sure if i m better keep thi to myself but hope it entertain you i don t mean ani offenc it s just i think blue rock is flopcum best wish to everyon,blue rock hey folk just wanted to text around and let you know that i feel blue rock in most if not all guise is literally shit i wa working the sound for a gig of it and i wa writing some thought down about it with ear plug in and i got into a spot of trouble with an audience member for it maybe like a soldier scared to fight and i wondered if anybody had any thought on how we could eradicate this together for good to stop future generation succumbing to it and to stop kid having to grow up with it in pub when they have them board outside saying live music but in capital letter whenever i hear something modern that s perhaps got a quick nod to blue rock i realised i think subconsciously aww that s cute i only just realised that i can t process it a music not a snob thing at all it s something else my brain responds to full blue rock like it s being invaded by a mindsucking bacteria no matter how proficient the guitar solo or impassioned the vocal it still get me a a total emptiness like if pure cliche wa a sensation or an energy then blue is the epicentre beyond boring into something further it show you a  space behind the bore an omni bore but it ha nowhere to go it is the blue it s like if you re playing wrestling with a friend when you are about ten and then they quickly shock you by pulling out a choke hold and squeeze your neck in real quick and it feel really dangerous and then they go back to playing and say gotchya in a nice voice that s like my first exposure to the blue it s like my neck is a little bit crushed so the choke hold can t squeeze it right anymore but the hold is in place anyway so i try and hold myself together and get through it the justification for it is that old blue lead to rock n roll i think that this might be propaganda and even though the evidence is there buried within the chord and voicing and occasional digga digga that is no reason to trust history to the extent that we perpetuate this a a reason to give it reverence no i say much of my own music can sound like annoying rubbish but nothing is like blue rock i think we should have a discussion with each other about how we can best broach a potential decommissioning to leave it to the few player that really seem to be able to play blue and make it have something maybe there could be a license or something you can get i m not sure if i m better keeping this to myself but hope it entertained you i don t mean any offence it s just i think blue rock is flopcum best wish to everyone

1304,between the line  interpret the phase trace welcom to what i plan to be a seri of post show analyz trace from the wild as well as an explan of what inform i glean from that data and how it inform my decis in the field base on my last post   reddit  it seem like some more technic writeup might be relev to thi commun i would welcom some feedback as to whether thi is the case if for no other reason than write them up is time consum okay then onto the good stuff i'm start with a common topic of confus what the heck is thi phase respons trace tell us well it tell us a lot of thing but one aspect of it is someth like ask the question what point in it cycl wa thi frequenc at when the measur wa taken for a singl frequenc thi tell us just about noth but when observ over a frequenc rang we can glean a lot of use inform for us we need to look for trend here is a veri basic rule of thumb that cover a lot of the common phase trace question  the steeper the phase trace slope the more time offset exist  if the slope is descend left to right the arriv is late if the slope is ascend left to right the arriv is earli let me be clear the phase trace indic lot of differ thing but thi simpl concept will get you some clariti in a lot of situat let' see some exampl   com/e1cauez   com/e1cauez here is a trace taken dure the benchtest of a system processor note that i person choos to view magnitud respons on top and phase respons on the bottom thi is the opposit of the default view in smaart so just be awar of that there' a few thing to point out here  the phase trace is descend left to right so it' indic a late arriv as i mention abov in thi particular case i simpli hadn't yet ad delay to the analyz to compens for the device' latenc the trace get steeper with frequenc becaus the same amount of time offset will caus more phase offset at higher frequenc becaus those cycl happen faster thi is linear we have twice as much phase offset at  as we do at  hz becaus the cycl take half the time the slope appear to be increas becaus of the log frequenc axi if you were to view the phase trace on a linear frequenc axi it would be a constant slope if you have rew which you should becaus it' free give it a tri  look at the magnitud display we see that the coher the red line across the top drop abov  khz and the associ frequenc respons data is no bueno thi is becaus the time delay is so much that at these frequenc the inform come back outsid the time window and therefor is not consid to correl with the refer signal think about an echo that take a week to come back it no longer correl with what we yell to caus the echo and so it' now nois that' what the coher trace show us how confid it is in the answer it' give put anoth way is the frequenc respons thi way becaus it' relat to the refer signal or is there just nois in the room that ha noth to do with our test signal how do we tell hvac from lf pink nois the analyz will do the same calcul a bunch of time and averag the result over success measur return the same answer over and over is high coher if it' wander around or what the mic is pick up doesn't seem to be relat to the signal we'r send out coher drop we can actual figur out how much delay we'r deal with by do a littl math the first wraparound pass through  again at just about  khz so we'v gone  one cycl back over a  hz rang   ms thi trick is more or less what we'r ask the analyz to do if we view a group delay plot let' enabl that option   com/v5srypi   com/v5srypi and there you have it a solid line at about  ms if the phase shift is caus by someth other than a linear time offset thi will not be a flat line so be care make infer about the entir frequenc range' delay base on use onli two point for the manual mental calcul if you'r wonder what those littl wiggl are i can't say for certain but my hypothesi is that those are the point at which the fft switch to a differ time window length mayb someon can enlighten me so let' look at how we might actual use thi knowledg in the wild thi imag show measur taken of two speaker left and right in a small home audio listen room with nasti acoust but that' anoth topic   com/lmhdahb   com/lmhdahb we have a few problem here but direct your attent to the phase trace at the listen posit where thi measur wa taken one of the speaker is arriv earlier becaus it' closer which one that would be the thicker teal trace becaus it ha a steeper slope more time offset and it' ascend from left to right earli arriv we have to look at the hf here becaus the lf ha the normal descend trend associ with lf driver and we'v got some bad modal issu interf we do a whole wrap whole cycl between  and  so let' add a millisecond delay to that channel in the dsp   com/aygedu3   com/aygedu3 much better in a larg venu situat larger than one listen thi is close enough for show busi becaus move over one seat will result in a complet differ result but thi is a listen room and we know exactli where the listen is go to be sit so let' get closer we'r about  degre off at  khz a full cycl at  khz is  ms so we don't need much delay to fix thi in fact a quarter cycl  would be  microsecond heh so let' chang our delay to  ms and see if we miss it the other way   com/g9bgjga   com/g9bgjga we do inde the final solut end up be     com/i7egjbx   com/i7egjbx i could have actual lock in all the way up to  khz given a dsp with suffici delay resolut but the distanc between the listener' ear is multipl wavelength at these frequenc so drill down ani further is arguabl pointless sinc both ear can't even perceiv the benefit plu i wa readi for my lunch break at that point hope thi wa help and not just a wast of my time i can't say how often i'll be abl to do writeup becaus i you know work and i realli like video game but happi to answer ani relev question about audio not video game edit sorri left out first imag fix,between the line  interpreting the phase trace welcome to what i plan to be a series of post showing analyzer trace from the wild a well a an explanation of what information i gleaned from that data and how it informed my decision in the field based on my last post   reddit  it seems like some more technical writeups might be relevant to this community i would welcome some feedback a to whether this is the case if for no other reason than writing them up is time consuming okay then onto the good stuff i'm starting with a common topic of confusion what the heck is this phase response trace telling u well it tell u a lot of thing but one aspect of it is something like asking the question what point in it cycle wa this frequency at when the measurement wa taken for a single frequency this tell u just about nothing but when observed over a frequency range we can glean a lot of useful information for u we need to look for trend here is a very basic rule of thumb that cover a lot of the common phase trace question  the steeper the phase trace slope the more time offset exists  if the slope is descending left to right the arrival is late if the slope is ascending left to right the arrival is early let me be clear the phase trace indicates lot of different thing but this simple concept will get you some clarity in a lot of situation let's see some example   com/e1cauez   com/e1cauez here is a trace taken during the benchtesting of a system processor note that i personally choose to view magnitude response on top and phase response on the bottom this is the opposite of the default view in smaart so just be aware of that there's a few thing to point out here  the phase trace is descending left to right so it's indicating a late arrival a i mentioned above in this particular case i simply hadn't yet added delay to the analyzer to compensate for the device's latency the trace get steeper with frequency because the same amount of time offset will cause more phase offset at higher frequency because those cycle happen faster this is linear we have twice a much phase offset at  a we do at  hz because the cycle take half the time the slope appears to be increasing because of the log frequency axis if you were to view the phase trace on a linear frequency axis it would be a constant slope if you have rew which you should because it's free give it a try  looking at the magnitude display we see that the coherence the red line across the top drop above  khz and the associated frequency response data is no bueno this is because the time delay is so much that at these frequency the information come back outside the time window and therefore is not considered to correlate with the reference signal think about an echo that take a week to come back it no longer correlate with what we yelled to cause the echo and so it's now noise that's what the coherence trace show u how confident it is in the answer it's giving put another way is the frequency response this way because it's related to the reference signal or is there just noise in the room that ha nothing to do with our test signal how do we tell hvac from lf pink noise the analyzer will do the same calculation a bunch of time and average the result over successive measurement returning the same answer over and over is high coherence if it's wandering around or what the mic is picking up doesn't seem to be related to the signal we're sending out coherence drop we can actually figure out how much delay we're dealing with by doing a little math the first wraparound pass through  again at just about  khz so we've gone  one cycle back over a  hz range   m this trick is more or le what we're asking the analyzer to do if we view a group delay plot let's enable that option   com/v5srypi   com/v5srypi and there you have it a solid line at about  m if the phase shift is caused by something other than a linear time offset this will not be a flat line so be careful making inference about the entire frequency range's delay based on using only two point for the manual mental calculation if you're wondering what those little wiggle are i can't say for certain but my hypothesis is that those are the point at which the fft switch to a different time window length maybe someone can enlighten me so let's look at how we might actually use this knowledge in the wild this image show measurement taken of two speaker left and right in a small home audio listening room with nasty acoustic but that's another topic   com/lmhdahb   com/lmhdahb we have a few problem here but direct your attention to the phase trace at the listening position where this measurement wa taken one of the speaker is arriving earlier because it's closer which one that would be the thicker teal trace because it ha a steeper slope more time offset and it's ascending from left to right early arrival we have to look at the hf here because the lf ha the normal descending trend associated with lf driver and we've got some bad modal issue interfering we do a whole wrap whole cycle between  and  so let's add a millisecond delay to that channel in the dsp   com/aygedu3   com/aygedu3 much better in a large venue situation larger than one listener this is close enough for show business because moving over one seat will result in a completely different result but this is a listening room and we know exactly where the listener is going to be sitting so let's get closer we're about  degree off at  khz a full cycle at  khz is  m so we don't need much delay to fix this in fact a quarter cycle  would be  microsecond heh so let's change our delay to  m and see if we miss it the other way   com/g9bgjga   com/g9bgjga we do indeed the final solution ended up being     com/i7egjbx   com/i7egjbx i could have actually locked in all the way up to  khz given a dsp with sufficient delay resolution but the distance between the listener's ear is multiple wavelength at these frequency so drilling down any further is arguably pointless since both ear can't even perceive the benefit plus i wa ready for my lunch break at that point hopefully this wa helpful and not just a waste of my time i can't say how often i'll be able to do writeups because i you know work and i really like video game but happy to answer any relevant question about audio not video game edit sorry left out first image fixed

90,ani way to add chapter marker to file dure record i hope thi is the right place for thi question tl dr i want to add chapter marker to a file while i am record it solut need to work in a window environ and i need to be abl to creat the chapter marker via command line i don't care what the file format is i have search for thi extens on googl but haven't found ani solut so either what i want is imposs or i'm use search for the wrong thing as it seem unlik that i'm the first person to want to do thi long version with detail i'm creat audio record of survey that will be use for research and qualiti control we current use sox to record becaus of the command line capabl mean we can use our survey administr softwar to automat turn on record when particip give consent i'd realli like to find a way to add chapter marker or similar embed data about where specif survey question start within the file thi would hope allow research and qualiti control staff to quickli find a singl question in a larg audio file for thi to be practic i need to be abl to pass thi inform via command line while the record is be creat i don't think sox can do thi but perhap someon here ha idea on whether thi can be accomplish with other tool i'm not wed to ani specif file format we current use mp3 but if there is a solut avail for thi i'm alreadi assum i need to chang to a differ format the survey we conduct rang in length between  minut and  hour and we conduct thousand of survey per year so edit chapter marker in post is out of scope i have consid break the record into mani singl question file but thi would mean creat hundr of file per survey administ so file manag could be cumbersom addit some question are veri short onli a few second and we have had issu with sox cut off the final coupl second of some file it seem when we creat a new file it discard whatev is in the buffer at that time instead of write it to the file so far thi ha been an accept level of data loss as we current onli split each survey into a few track due to our experi with sox becom unstabl with mp3 track over  minut in length howev it would not be accept to lose the final second of everi question we administ becaus that would often mean lose the answer given by the survey particip thank for read and consid thi problem,any way to add chapter marker to file during recording i hope this is the right place for this question tl dr i want to add chapter marker to a file while i am recording it solution need to work in a window environment and i need to be able to create the chapter marker via command line i don't care what the file format is i have searched for this extensively on google but haven't found any solution so either what i want is impossible or i'm using searching for the wrong thing a it seems unlikely that i'm the first person to want to do this long version with detail i'm creating audio recording of survey that will be used for research and quality control we currently use sox to record because of the command line capability meaning we can use our survey administration software to automatically turn on recording when participant give consent i'd really like to find a way to add chapter marker or similar embedded data about where specific survey question start within the file this would hopefully allow researcher and quality control staff to quickly find a single question in a large audio file for this to be practical i need to be able to pas this information via command line while the recording is being created i don't think sox can do this but perhaps someone here ha idea on whether this can be accomplished with other tool i'm not wed to any specific file format we currently use mp3 but if there is a solution available for this i'm already assuming i need to change to a different format the survey we conduct range in length between  minute and  hour and we conduct thousand of survey per year so editing chapter marker in post is out of scope i have considered breaking the recording into many single question file but this would mean creating hundred of file per survey administered so file management could be cumbersome additionally some question are very short only a few second and we have had issue with sox cutting off the final couple second of some file it seems when we create a new file it discard whatever is in the buffer at that time instead of writing it to the file so far this ha been an acceptable level of data loss a we currently only split each survey into a few track due to our experience with sox becoming unstable with mp3 track over  minute in length however it would not be acceptable to lose the final second of every question we administer because that would often mean losing the answer given by the survey participant thanks for reading and considering this problem

articl on the subject by foh engin jim yakabuski   prosoundweb com/channels/l sound/backstag class a tune standard/ i am fortun to call jim a friend and we'v had mani convers about thi particular topic for me person it depend on what the system will be use for speech or music as well as the local acoust environ how much lf buildup the room will contribut ultim thi question will be answer by listen to refer record and tweak the tilt until it sound correct then that becom the target curv to which i'll match the rest of the system rest of the system in thi case mean the other side the initi respons actual had a slight upward tilt to it look at  khz and up   com/a9e7pax   com/a9e7pax thi is partli becaus the room is small enough that a lot of the hf bounc off the wall and ceil show up in the measur notic poor coher and also partli becaus we'r onli about  feet away from a rel larg loudspeak that' design to throw a lot farther than across a live room so there' not nearli as much hf air attenu as we would see further back in it intend applic thi make sens but it sound quit bad as confirm by listen to my refer music so let' fix that   com/3aoras9   com/3aoras9 pink pre eq raw respons blue post eq now hold your hors i'm sure you are wonder about that  hz peak and i'll get there i use a hi shelf filter at  khz to get rid of that upward tilt and a cut at around  hz to rein in that midrang bump that might be a lobe from the crossov it' a  system and the listen posit is vertic below onax but  still seem low to me or it might be a modal thing the deep narrow cancel on either side lend credenc to both hypothes and sinc they'r cancel you can't eq them back up to normal to a first approxim that is true if it is modal good acoust treatment can do a world of good but that' not within the scope of the job okay so for the  hz issu thi look surprisingli similar to the sub bump that you see on a modern larg format pa system out of the box see thi imag   com/iubw6nt if it look familiar it' becaus it' from the same setup as pictur in the jim yak articl i link abov jim snap it on hi phone it show hi k2 rig out of the box with sub mute and there' still a heck of an lf bump hi magnitud trace is bottom pane which is the smaart default sinc thi system is primarili go to be use for the owner to play loud rock music i left it we'r run without sub here so thi is actual an impress show it didn't sound reson or honki dure playback if it end up be too much we can alway go back and roll it back but i suspect it will work out well for the owner of the system thi is a judgement call though so there' no right or wrong just what' best for the situat usual we also feed the output of the dsp into the analyz so we can see the eq curv on the screen as well while thi is extrem help it' not strictli necessari and in thi case it' not possibl sinc the dsp is onboard the activ loudspeak so here we just see the befor and after respons i'll includ a screenshot of the final filter set from the dsp at the end so you can see the filter i use the appli eq look like a rel minor chang on the screen but boy did it sound a whole lot better i'm use  oct averag which is lower resolut than i usual prefer but becaus of the low coher and nasti room problem more averag clarifi the gener trend for me in thi case we'r deal in broad stroke here not tri to go in and equal everi singl littl bump for a varieti of reason the small scale detail tend not to be veri audibl wherea the ear is incred respons to the wideband stuff for exampl after listen the hf still sound too bright and one more db on the shelf work wonder so by focus on the broad stroke we can make some realli big improv with rel few gentl filter note the phase respons befor and after is almost ident the filter here are so low q that there' virtual no chang thi would not be the case for realli narrow high q filter which are all too often adopt by the autoeq plugin etc the phase shift itself is of cours not audibl but the reson certainli can be now let' go back and see the post eq left compar to the right channel   com/i7egjbx   com/i7egjbx the match phase trace indic match arriv time at the listen posit see part  and so look next at the magnitud trace on top we can see further issu the right loudspeak brown trace is significantli louder than the left side if it' within a db it' noth to write home about but these graph have a vertic scale of  db / divis so what we'r see here is signific it' also audibl it' import to alway check these thing as we go a simpl listen test can prevent you from make bad decis base on improp or incomplet data it' import to rememb that the analyz simpli give us more data and it' up to us to interpret that data and make an inform decis so we need a gain chang how much it' easi to offset trace in the softwar until they line up in thi case it end up be  db that' larger than a manufactur toler so befor crank the gain in dsp it help to actual determin what the issu is in thi case one of the input gain block in the loudspeaker' onboard dsp wa set incorrectli and after remov the attenu l and r line up just fine   com/oyege6o   com/oyege6o right' just a smidg higher but that' okay becaus we'r look at it unequ respons vs left' equal respons sinc most of the eq work will be subtract thi is noth to be concern about right side eq choic were similarli spare   com/qzdcjwt   com/qzdcjwt red trace is post eq and here' l and r togeth   com/t62cyvt   com/t62cyvt consid the bad room l and r are pretti well match in a tonal sens the eq necessari for thi wa

for some reason note that the macro trend are the same gentl cut in the lo mid and the hf i end up with two cascad hf shelf cut to get it to sound right up top again the analyz cannot provid thi data trust your ear but then look at the analyz so we can correl what we'r see with what sound good i know there are some other system tech hide in the weed out there and everyone' got their own recip so by all mean all correct / comment / altern interpret are welcom also hey i do thi for a live so if anyon is interest in have me come tune your system and/or teach peopl how to do it lemm know d,between the line  broad stroke hi all read on for part  of the same system we were looking at the other day interesting application a it's a listening room so we're only concerned about the system response at a single point in space this side step a lot of the spacial variance issue that are at the heart of sound system optimization for large venue but there are still some basic we can take a look at if you missed part  it is here   reddit  i'm going to start by just looking at the left side on it own there's a great debate over whether a sound system's frequency response should be flat or tilted and then how much tilt and what corner frequency and on and on for a variety of opinion see this roundtable article   prosoundweb com/channels/live sound/flat or tilted a variety of approach to the system tuning process/ also check out this article on the subject by foh engineer jim yakabuski   prosoundweb com/channels/live sound/backstage class a tuning standard/ i am fortunate to call jim a friend and we've had many conversation about this particular topic for me personally it depends on what the system will be used for speech or music a well a the local acoustic environment how much lf buildup the room will contribute ultimately this question will be answered by listening to reference recording and tweaking the tilt until it sound correct then that becomes the target curve to which i'll match the rest of the system rest of the system in this case mean the other side the initial response actually had a slight upward tilt to it look at  khz and up   com/a9e7pax   com/a9e7pax this is partly because the room is small enough that a lot of the hf bouncing off the wall and ceiling show up in the measurement notice poor coherence and also partly because we're only about  foot away from a relatively large loudspeaker that's designed to throw a lot farther than across a living room so there's not nearly a much hf air attenuation a we would see further back in it intended application this make sense but it sounded quite bad a confirmed by listening to my reference music so let's fix that   com/3aoras9   com/3aoras9 pink pre eq raw response blue post eq now hold your horse i'm sure you are wondering about that  hz peak and i'll get there i used a hi shelf filter at  khz to get rid of that upward tilt and a cut at around  hz to rein in that midrange bump that might be a lobe from the crossover it's a  system and the listening position is vertically below onax but  still seems low to me or it might be a modal thing the deep narrow cancellation on either side lend credence to both hypothesis and since they're cancellation you can't eq them back up to normal to a first approximation that is true if it is modal good acoustic treatment can do a world of good but that's not within the scope of the job okay so for the  hz issue this look surprisingly similar to the sub bump that you see on a modern large format pa system out of the box see this image   com/iubw6nt if it look familiar it's because it's from the same setup a pictured in the jim yak article i linked above jim snapped it on his phone it show his k2 rig out of the box with sub muted and there's still a heck of an lf bump his magnitude trace is bottom pane which is the smaart default since this system is primarily going to be used for the owner to play loud rock music i left it we're running without sub here so this is actually an impressive showing it didn't sound resonant or honky during playback if it end up being too much we can always go back and roll it back but i suspect it will work out well for the owner of the system this is a judgement call though so there's no right or wrong just what's best for the situation usually we also feed the output of the dsp into the analyzer so we can see the eq curve on the screen a well while this is extremely helpful it's not strictly necessary and in this case it's not possible since the dsp is onboard the active loudspeaker so here we just see the before and after response i'll include a screenshot of the final filter setting from the dsp at the end so you can see the filter i used the applied eq look like a relatively minor change on the screen but boy did it sound a whole lot better i'm using  oct averaging which is lower resolution than i usually prefer but because of the low coherence and nasty room problem more averaging clarified the general trend for me in this case we're dealing in broad stroke here not trying to go in and equalize every single little bump for a variety of reason the small scale detail tend not to be very audible whereas the ear is incredibly responsive to the wideband stuff for example after listening the hf still sounded too bright and one more db on the shelf worked wonder so by focusing on the broad stroke we can make some really big improvement with relatively few gentle filter note the phase response before and after is almost identical the filter here are so low q that there's virtually no change this would not be the case for really narrow high q filter which are all too often adopted by the autoeq plugins etc the phase shift itself is of course not audible but the resonance certainly can be now let's go back and see the post eq left compared to the right channel   com/i7egjbx   com/i7egjbx the matched phase trace indicate matched arrival time at the listening position see part  and so looking next at the magnitude trace on top we can see further issue the right loudspeaker brown trace is significantly louder than the left side if it's within a db it's nothing to write home about but these graph have a vertical scaling of  db / division so what we're seeing here is significant it's also audible it's important to always check these thing a we go a simple listening test can prevent you from making bad decision based on improper or incomplete data it's important to remember that the analyzer simply give u more data and it's up to u to interpret that data and make an informed decision so we need a gain change how much it's easy to offset trace in the software until they line up in this case it ended up being  db that's larger than a manufacturing tolerance so before cranking the gain in dsp it help to actually determine what the issue is in this case one of the input gain block in the loudspeaker's onboard dsp wa set incorrectly and after removing the attenuation l and r lined up just fine   com/oyege6o   com/oyege6o right's just a smidge higher but that's okay because we're looking at it unequalized response v left's equalized response since most of the eq work will be subtractive this is nothing to be concerned about right side eq choice were similarly sparing   com/qzdcjwt   com/qzdcjwt red trace is post eq and here's l and r together   com/t62cyvt   com/t62cyvt considering the bad room l and r are pretty well matched in a tonal sense the eq necessary for this wa asymmetrical because the room itself a well a the loudspeakers' placement within is also asymmetrical   com/yuvcze4   com/yuvcze4 focus on the white line because even bypassed filter contribute to the blue shading for some reason note that the

944,speaker recommend for a jazz venu hey all look for some recommend for a pa system for the venu i manag we'r a  ft extrem oddli shape room   com/a/njsbfml our venu exclus present jazz mostli modern stuff sinc the room is small enough the acoust level of the drum realli dictat what we throw in the pa which is usual piano and voic and occasion horn that aren't way too loud our room is sort of treat so there isn't stuff bounc around all over the place but definit still a live kind of boomi room our current system is a pair of macki sa1530z the issu i encount is how the sound of the room chang base on where you'r sit in the middl area of the room up to where the mixer is there' a rais roof that goe up about  feet the room is at it' regular height at the stage and behind the mixer which is  feet as you might guess the chang in roof size affect the sound and thing sound differ on stage vs right in front of the stage vs all the way behind the mixer addit the room also get tinier as in like an l shape so you realli don't get much of the stage right speaker in the back of the room my first thought is that the macki are rais at the  feet height of the ceil so hang at about   feet and are point straight which affect the peopl at the front of the room sit sort of underneath the speaker they don't get as much of it as someon sit in the back as i mention the room is treat but the shape of the room is realli hard to fight so there' onli so much the treatment can do for us so for now i'd like to solv the speaker issu and see if there' ani better option avail for a  ft room two  speaker are a bit much i think although i can't seem to find anyth smaller than that that is also  way so my first question/assumpt is chang the way my current macki are mount by aim them a bit more down would that help the distribut of sound my second question is are there ani speaker that may be better suit for the job for a second i wa think about do a faux vertic array with  speaker  on each side one pair point straight ahead and one pair point down more but mayb there' a singl pair of speaker that may do the trick without have to work on an array i should mention my budget for thi is  hope less obvious chang the mount on my current speaker would be the cheapest option probabl not run me ani more than  for the part and labor but speaker i'v been look at have been  each hope to hear some good suggest and thank in advanc,speaker recommendation for a jazz venue hey all looking for some recommendation for a pa system for the venue i manage we're a  ft extremely oddly shaped

that go up about  foot the room is at it's regular height at the stage and behind the mixer which is  foot a you might guess the change in roof size affect the sound and thing sound different on stage

1288,whi is there no daw consol it' possibl that thi exist and i'm not awar of it so pleas forgiv me in that case to clarifi what i mean by daw consol when you set up a studio or live record you'll gener have a daw and a consol that interfac with it that creat a redund situat becaus daw will typic have a virtual mixer that ha basic all the same function of your physic mix consol even with a simpl audio interfac without full channel process you'll usual still have rout option that oper independ from the intern rout in your daw and preamp that need to be control separ what i think would be interest is a consol that' essenti a glorifi audio interfac daw control with digit control preamp that are control from within the softwar all surfac control actual control your daw' virtual mixer and all rout mirror your daw rout the softwar could be a special version of protools/cubase/etc that' meant to be control with thi mixer the mix engin would be a power comput that' dedic to run the daw at low latenc you can then run all your favourit vst and plugin dure live perform and you can record multitrack and play thing back easili i hope thi make sens let me know what you think doe that exist,why is there no daw console it's possible that this exists and i'm not aware of it so please forgive me in that case to clarify what i mean by daw console when you set up a studio or live recording you'll generally have a daw and a console that interface with it that creates a redundant situation because daw will typically have a virtual mixer that ha basically all the same functionality of your physical mixing console even with a simple audio interface without full channel processing you'll usually still have routing option that operate independently from the internal routing in your daw and preamps that need to be controlled separately what i think would be interesting is a console that's essentially a glorified audio interface daw controller with digitally controlled preamps that are controlled from within the software all surface control actually control your daw's virtual mixer and all routing mirror your daw routing the software could be a specialized version of protools/cubase/etc that's meant to be controlled with this mixer the mix engine would be a powerful computer that's dedicated to running the daw at low latency you can then run all your favourite vsts and plugins during live performance and you can record multitrack and play thing back easily i hope this make sense let me know what you think doe that exist

be preced by the proaudiodsp dsm in  which wa itself preced by the voxengo soniform in like  thi melda one seem to be the most configur and have the most featur such as sidechain which allow it to perform the same function of anoth special plugin wavesfactory' trackspac   wavesfactori com/trackspacer/ thi allow you to duck onli the share frequenc between two track spectral process kinda lead down a rabbit hole with someth like unfilt audio' specop   unfilteredaudio com/collections/plug ins/products/specop at the bottom i have no idea what it' do or whi but it creat sound i'v never heard befor pretti much anyth from sound radix   soundradix com/ these develop seem to be on anoth level auto align find the most phase coher delay between two track drum level is like a smart compand that can also be sidechain to use the transient of one track as an envelop for anoth pi is realli special it adjust the phase of multipl track in real time to achiev the most coher output signal possibl

a free delay that use granular synthesi you can read up on granular synthesi if you'r unfamiliar but suffic to say that is a complet uniqu delay that creat soundscap out of noth there are other uniqu

1043,tri to buy a sound system for an a cappella group what do you think our budget right now would be about  but we will be slowli ad more over the next few year right now we alreadi have a mixer and speaker with an amplifi which belong to member of the group but eventu we will buy those as well the object is to get some kind of practic hold and perform with mic practic blend but we would also like to take it to gig we need   mic and we would realli like for it to be wireless as that allow us to practic choreographi for competit there a few main possibl that i see  get a full set of good wire mic think the sm58  x   includ cabl but not a snake thi will be most benefici to allow us to hear ourselv and practic on an actual sound system but it doesn t realli let us practic choreo my thought is that if we are primarili concern about icca practic it may be better to do what we ve done in the past and just go practic on someon els s system  get a full set of okayish wireless mic perhap the vocopro uhf   x  which is a set of   so these are lower qualiti mic but will still get the job done for right now these would be veri easi to take to gig becaus we wouldn t have to worri about set up a wire system and a snake they will still give us significantli better sound than ani gig we ve liter ever perform at we could definit use these to practic for icca s and do chore as well they just won t give us as profession of a sound  get some wireless mic of slightli less qualiti and then two of good qualiti think the vocopro uhf  for the less qualiti and then sennheis  for the good one  x  set of  uhf  and then  x  set of  e825 thi set up would allow us to have a fulli wireless system which let us practic icca and choreo and stuff but it also give good sound qualiti for the soloist and mayb a bass of vp thi would give great sound qualiti for gig but again might be compromis a bit more in term of listen to ourselv in rehears would love ani feedback or ani insight on experi with ani of these mic,trying to buy a sound system for an a cappella group what do you think our budget right now would be about  but we will be slowly adding more over the next few year right now we already have a mixer and speaker with an amplifier which belong to member of the group but eventually we will buy those a well the objective is to get some kind of practice holding and performing with mics practicing blend but we would also like to take it to gig we need   mics and we would really like for it to be wireless a that allows u to practice choreography for competition there a few main possibility that i see  get a full set of good wired mics thinking the sm58  x   including cable but not a snake this will be most beneficial to allowing u to hear ourselves and practice on an actual sound system but it doesn t really let u practice choreo my thought is that if we are primarily concerned about icca practice it may be better to do what we ve done in the past and just go practice on someone else s system  get a full set of okayish wireless mics perhaps the vocopro uhf   x  which is a set of   so these are lower quality mics but will still get the job done for right now these would be very easy to take to gig because we wouldn t have to worry about setting up a wired system and a snake they will still give u significantly better sound than any gig we ve literally ever performed at we could definitely use these to practice for icca s and do chore a well they just won t give u a professional of a sound  get some wireless mics of slightly le quality and then two of good quality thinking the vocopro uhf  for the le quality and then sennheiser  for the good one  x  set of  uhf  and then  x  set of  e825 this set up would allow u to have a fully wireless system which let u practice icca and choreo and stuff but it also give good sound quality for the soloist and maybe a bass of vp this would give great sound quality for gig but again might be compromising a bit more in term of listening to ourselves in rehearsal would love any feedback or any insight on experience with any of these mics

spectrogram at  band appear live of onli low frequenc audio show everyth up to  hz it onli look good after about  minut as it need to show some durat for the sake of sharp i'm look to further analys thi and improv the qualiti of the analysi i also have some distant nois come in in higher frequenc record at higher sampl rate that i wish to isol use whatev nois reduct tool i can find so far i have tri variou combin of applic and plugin includ built in nois reduct use adob audit   built in nois reduct use adob audit  built in nois reduct use adob audit cc2015 izotop rx  izotop ozon  spectralay

to remov which work surprisingli well but today i had an idea and i need to post thi and share becaus the best idea seem to come from think outsid of the box what i did wa thi i use an old audio effect program call hog v0  to load a wav record and convolv it the trick is  take the wav sampl with the quiet bg sound you wish to isol and slow it way way down to like  slower than the origin be sure to re sampl and not time stretch ugh  load the  slower version into hog convolv it use the follow paramet input load your slow down wav sampl here impuls load your slow down wav sampl here ye the same file we will self convolv output name your new file whatev make sens for you turn on move brighten and  bit normal no scale impuls no mix back input window blackman _harri impuls length   length is measur in second process it  open your output wav and re sampl it back to the origin durat and viola it is a new method of nois reduct note1 best for use on veri quiet sound among background air sound note2 horribl for use on clarifi garbl speech or differenti speech among other peopl btw if anyon know method for how to do that let me know best i'v tri so far is manual select use adob audit cc2015 and spectralay req1 if anyon tri thi method and discov better set along the way or interest idea pleas share that' what thi post is for req2 if anyon know ani other rare or interest audio restor or just ani interest effect similar to these pleas share that as well i'm on the lookout for more method i know about cedar studio  i just cant afford it i wish there wa a trial version i could use but i can't find one so that' anoth thing i'm look for i'm determin to improv thi setup and i'm happi to help anyon with idea or wish to make a similar setup,low frequency spectrogram technique noise reduction technique i hear a low frequency hum where i live in west baltimore city it's louder at night only in winter and come and go over long period like several hour i have some theory but this isn't about that anyway in order to analyse i have two  bass amplifier plugged in a microphone which work beautifully one in the basement on the floor and one on the first floor of the house i can view a real time stereo spectrogram using adobe audition   recording at only  hz i picked this frequency because it's  the normal sample rate that i use and i can see a beautiful high resolution spectrogram at  band appear live of only low frequency audio showing everything up to  hz it only look good after about  minute a it need to show some duration for the sake of sharpness i'm looking to further analyse this and improve the quality of the analysis i also have some distant noise coming in in higher frequency recorded at higher sampling rate that i wish to isolate using whatever noise reduction tool i can find so far i have tried various combination of application and plugins including built in noise reduction using adobe audition   built in noise reduction using adobe audition  built in noise reduction using adobe audition cc2015 izotope rx  izotope ozone  spectralayers pro  one of the best spear isse praat ar wave wns wave x noise wave z noise acon restoration acon's de hum is the best live de hum effect i have found up to  harmonic with live attenuation odd only option diamond cut forensics  dcf's de hum is the best post processing de hum effect up to  harmonic odd only option sound it  pro which come with the sonnox restoration bundle and even celemony melodyne  for selecting unwanted partial to remove which work surprisingly well but today i had an idea and i needed to post this and share because the best idea seem to come from thinking outside of the box what i did wa this i used an old audio effect program called hog v0  to load a wav recording and convolve it the trick is  take the wav sample with the quiet bg sound you wish to isolate and slow it way way down to like  slower than the original be sure to re sample and not time stretch ugh  load the  slower version into hog convolve it using the following parameter input load your slowed down wav sample here impulse load your slowed down wav sample here yes the same file we will self convolve output name your new file whatever make sense for you turn on moving brighten and  bit normalize no scale impulse no mix back input window blackman _harris impulse length   length is measured in second process it  open your output wav and re sample it back to the original duration and viola it is a new method of noise reduction note1 best for use on very quiet sound among background air sound note2 horrible for use on clarifying garbled speech or differentiating speech among other people btw if anyone know method for how to do that let me know best i've tried so far is manually selecting using adobe audition cc2015 and spectralayers req1 if anyone try this method and discovers better setting along the way or interesting idea please share that's what this post is for req2 if anyone know any other rare or interesting audio restoration or just any interesting effect similar to these please share that a well i'm on the lookout for more method i know about cedar studio  i just cant

1763,shure blx vs glx d advanc or other budget option i'm look for a new wireless microphon system to recommend for a low budget oper we typic use  mic per show and  handheld  of which are age and also affect by the  spectrum realloc as for the other   of them is a  seri audio technica that happen to be i band so isn't affect the rest were d band and the remain  are new shure blx system we bought last year a t hadn't updat their line in a long while and when they final did they made a new connector that seemingli isn't compat with ani mic they don't make themselv the blx system seem nice enough better than the old system for sure but the cheaper materi and the non remov yet flexibl antenna make me nervou about their longev they also seem quit hot sound wise last year though i'm still think there' someth on our end we'r miss on that front plan to do some experiment regard that gain issu thi thanksgiv befor audit time to see if it improv all in all they work well enough but we want them to last as long as we can i think i can get away with push a higher end offer if they'll work better or last longer but there' no way we can jump up to a qlx/ulx or someth that costli i wa then look to see if shure offer a mid market option and they do but it wa a   system and i quickli dismiss thi howev their new advanc system is caus me to give it anoth look they claim to handl up to  channel and if we keep blx for part of our setup the thought is we could have  or so run on glx reliabl thi would allow us to have more rf spectrum to work with to coordin our other mic as we tour around those system appear to be better made the batteri system also look to be a huge conveni never have to worri about batteri die in show or convinc someon to go run to walmart for more again with time remain indic and a recharg spare right in the receiv and they'll never be affect by futur fcc spectrum chang but that said at the end of the day they have to work and while we'r mostli perform away from dens wi fi area i don't want there to be a major problem with the mani wireless devic our team actor and audienc use tech crew often sit in audienc area our tech setup is somewher around   from the stage our snake is  long so it shouldn't ever be much further back than that again we sit in the audienc and have the antenna clear the audienc ha been an issu befor with uhf and i wonder if   will make that wors ha anyon tri thi use the glx d adv frequenc manag with the stock antenna i would expect it to work with the paddl becaus they'r direct but becaus of our quick setup tour and budget focus natur ad the time and cost expens of set up paddl antenna right up by the stage probabl wouldn't be worth it i'm also interest if there are other option anyon may recommend in that sort of price rang right now i'm still lean toward just push to get more blx system becaus it' still cheaper and doesn't have   problem but if there' a better but still cost practic way i'd love to hear it thank for ani info tl dr we are replac our mic system blx in earli test had some problem and concern but not terribl is glx d adv worth the upgrad or will it caus even more problem and is there a better option to consid thank,shure blx v glx d advanced or other budget option i'm looking for a new wireless microphone system to recommend for a low budget operation we typically use  mics per show and  handhelds  of which are aging and also affected by the  spectrum reallocation a for the other   of them is a  series audio technica that happened to be i band so isn't affected the rest were d band and the remaining  are new shure blx system we bought last year a t hadn't updated their line in a long while and when they finally did they made a new connector that seemingly isn't compatible with any mics they don't make themselves the blx system seem nice enough better than the old system for sure but the cheaper material and the non removable yet flexible antenna make me nervous about their longevity they also seemed quite hot sound wise last year though i'm still thinking there's something on our end we're missing on that front planning to do some experimentation regarding that gain issue this thanksgiving before audition time to see if it improves all in all they work well enough but we want them to last a long a we can i think i can get away with pushing a higher end offering if they'll work better or last longer but there's no way we can jump up to a qlx/ulx or something that costly i wa then looking to see if shure offered a mid market option and they do but it wa a   system and i quickly dismissed this however their new advanced system is causing me to give it another look they claim to handle up to  channel and if we keep blx for part of our setup the thought is we could have  or so running on glx reliably this would allow u to have more rf spectrum to work with to coordinate our other mics a we tour around those system appear to be better made the battery system also look to be a huge convenience never having to worry about battery dying in show or convincing someone to go running to walmart for more again with time remaining indicator and a rechargeable spare right in the receiver and they'll never be affected by future fcc spectrum change but that said at the end of the day they have to work and while we're mostly performing away from dense wi fi area i don't want there to be a major problem with the many wireless device our team actor and audience us tech crew often sits in audience area our tech setup is somewhere around   from the stage our snake is  long so it shouldn't ever be much further back than that again we sit in the audience and having the antenna clear the audience ha been an issue before with uhf and i wonder if   will make that worse ha anyone tried this using the glx d adv frequency manager with the stock antenna i would expect it to work with the paddle because they're directional but because of our quick setup touring and budget focused nature adding the time and cost expense of setting up paddle antenna right up by the stage probably wouldn't be worth it i'm also interested if there are other option anyone may recommend in that sort of price range right now i'm still leaning toward just pushing to get more blx system because it's still cheaper and doesn't have   problem but if there's a better but still cost practical way i'd love to hear it thanks for any info tl dr we are replacing our mic system blx in early testing had some problem and concern but not terrible is glx d adv worth the upgrade or will it cause even more problem and is there a better option to consider thanks

an older guy and doesn't know much about comput of powerpoint so i'm stuck deal with all of that bullshit befor present our biggest account had us come to a hotel and run a confer the sale and banquet staff didn't look at the setup diagram and move hi tabl from where they were suppos to be and he chew me out for it he wa upset people' youtub video wouldn't automat play they won't in the most recent

order and fill it or receive it he's an older guy and doesn't know much about computer of powerpoint so i'm stuck dealing with all of that bullshit before presentation our biggest account had u come to a hotel and run a conference the sale and banquet staff didn't look at the setup diagram and moved his table from where they were supposed to be and he chewed me out for it he wa upset people's youtube video wouldn't automatically play they won't in the most recent version of powerpoint i converted the video i could to mpeg and set them to automatically play but one wa too large and had choppy playback even when i compressed it that presenter had to use presenter view and you can't click play on youtube video in presenter view i stayed  and  hour past when i wa scheduled to try to come to a solution and all i could do wa switch to slideshow mode when she came to that slide that account wrote my bos a nasty email saying she had given her presentation all over the nation and the youtube video played automatically when she gave it anywhere else last week i setup for a group with two presenter one of them had been a surgeon for  year he wa giving a deep presentation on the connection between war robotics and surgery he came up and said can we go through my presentation i don't have a computer anymore i just make powerpoints on my ipad they had only paid my company for a tech to be there till start and it wa about  minute till he wa supposed to start the guy had all his text in comic sans and had  video on his thumb drive that he didn't embed in the presentation they were all supposed to be in a slide and start automatically he said oh i thought when i downloaded a video to my thumb drive it would just add a slide on my powerpoint i got him situated and then my bos call and say they messed up an invoice and i need to run a rental across town that the client needed yesterday the guy asked me to stay and basically baby him through his presentation and i got the hell out of there that brings me to this morning i setup for a presenter and his sponsor group at a ritzy club in the more affluent part of the city they had one lav mic on the order and a cheap mackie mixer patched to their house speaker including some video accessory to get a laptop to their projector and some  inch monitor display the presenter had mailed the venue a flash drive with his powerpoint in advance so i loaded it up and saw he had a video embedded in it but didn't have the actual file on the drive the event staff and his sponsor kept pestering me and asking what i could do and i kept trying to break it to them that he didn't have the file and it wasn't a video available online somewhere the presenter changed his presentation around to accommodate this but then came more bull shit the master of ceremony came up to my  minute before start and complained that the venue's wireless mic wasn't working and said how doe this even happen i got it working then when the main presenter came up with a lav he went from   speech level within a moment notice and i kept trying to duck him the master of ceremony told me no one could hear him and that i needed to push him up so of course he kept feeding back i only had a cheap mackie board with  band eq's and couldn't really cut anything to push the system up any louder so of course he started feeding back then he got to a blank slide with his name and logo on it and asked me if there wa a problem with his clicker no there is not have you gone over your presentation advance to the next slide the snooty folk who sponsored the event apologized to me for being snotty and throwing so many wrench at me and asked if i wa ok and even said they'd call u again but someone still emailed my bos a really nasty complaint i don't know how long i want to stay in this at this point i wa excited to start doing some live sound and video but i'm literally a roadie for presenter who don't know how to use powerpoint and haven't prepared their presentation i'm microsoft powerpoint tech support at this point and even when i try my best it result in complaint doe av get anymore fulfilling a friend of mine is a stagehand for theatre company and it seemed like a good gig but he work  hour a week or so and drive a box truck or semi all over the u i just wanna find a way to work my way up to doing front of house for someone are there any other immediately accessible career in av that aren't a demeaning and are actually more audio and video based instead of microsoft powerpoint any other advice for me i'm gonna stay here until i find something else stacking box in truck   hour a day for a year taught me how good i have it right now thanks fella

1850,concern about potenti for hear loss as audienc member and perform at concert until i'm abl to afford a wireless iem system is it possibl to buy custom ear plug that block out or quiet the most harm frequencies/sound level while still allow for adequ listening/monitor warn long post i'm hope to start a proper band project and start play bar gig but i'm veri concern about the potenti for hear loss i attend bar show on a weekli basi sometim twice a week but the one thing well apart from the tendenc to get pull into excess late night and too much drink that realli drive me nut is the loud of basic everi singl concert i attend there' absolut noth i can do about thi sinc everi guitarist want to blast their amp to  which i absolut understand as a guitarist myself ego is a hell of a drug but also becaus most of these bar space are pretti small and even without the live sound run through the speaker the sound in that enclos space is deafen what i'm wonder is if there are custom ear plug that can be purchas that might allow me to block out the more oppress sound level and frequenc to preserv my hear yet still allow me to hear enough of what i need to hear for enjoy of concert and monitor myself and my bandmat as a perform play on stage at these venu later thi year i have notic one of the long term musician in the scene wear what appear to be custom made ear plug that he ha around hi neck on a string that he wear at concert i can onli presum that they are built in such a way that he can still almost fulli enjoy the music at show and hear what he need to hear while protect hi hear doe anyon here have ani advic they could give me on such type of ear plug i imagin i might need to see an audiologist for these if they exist and they will cost in the  but i'm definit will to spend say   on someth like thi if can potenti preserv my hear and let me keep play and listen to music for the rest of my life question about custom ear plug and/or iem while perform my understand at the moment is that some sort of wireless iem system would be the way to go for protect my ear yet still be abl to hear what i need to hear while perform i do have a pair of shure se210 and se110 though it look like it would still cost anoth  cad to get the whole wireless monitor system which i can't realli afford at the moment therefor i'm wonder if the sort of custom ear plug mention abov might allow me to protect my hear while play live yet still let enough sound through to adequ monitor thing though i get that thi might not be possibl sinc iem would actual allow sound to come through the earbud to let me hear thing wherea ear plug would just block out sound nevertheless it would be interest to see if there is some sort of middl ground between do noth and spend  for a wireless iem system on that note sinc i alreadi do have a coupl set of shure iem is it at all possibl to build some kind of semi portabl wire monitor system that i could use on stage mayb involv use a littl cheap super basic behring type  or  channel mixer that i could have on stage with me and connect to the iem i know the main issu would be with tri to connect my mixer to the 'monitor sends' from the main mix board at the venu and of cours that might not be practic to run some  foot cabl from the sound guy' board all the way to the stage for me to use for monitor howev a at some local dedic music venu they do alreadi seem to have some kind of long cabl run a 'snake' link the stage to the soundboard where there are some  input jack avail for the guitarist to plug their guitar into that connect to the board b with these guitar input jack there are also long speaker wire run connect to some monitor speaker on the stage that perform use to hear themselv with thi kind of setup would it be theoret possibl to have the  inch speaker wire or mayb a super long  audio cabl run from the sound guy' booth that i could connect into a littl cheap mini mixer i have on stage next to me that i can plug my shure iem into so i can listen to both myself and the 'hous mix' of all the other instrument in my band while dial in my own monitor mix right there on stage also with thi kind of hypothet setup could i incorpor some kind of limit or compressor or nois reduc system that could protect my ear from ani sudden spike in volum come from the sound guy' board would a guitar nois reduc or compressor pedal work for that or would i need someth more special as bad as loud volum alreadi are at concert i can't imagin anyth wors for hear that a sudden surg in volum or feedback that run directli through my iem into my eardrum that' a terrifi prospect to consid there are musician friend i know who are incred talent yet quit a bit younger than me who have alreadi suffer consider hear loss meanwhil i know there are even some veteran sound guy who have suffer hear loss significantli which can't help with their job either i wa at  bar show in the last week alon and while i took break dure the first two for the last one i tough it out becaus i wa realli into the perform which is what i'v typic done up til now but i regret it alreadi as soon as i walk outsid midway through the last show my ear felt like they were complet clog and underwat and i had mild tinnitu for a good half hour after the pain i feel in my ear from the crank guitar and amp is almost immedi and i tri to sit further back from the stage though thi doesn't do much in small bar i also tri to take regular break becaus i can't stand the verit onslaught of sound i'll sometim feel a bit queasi over how loud thing are though then i feel bad for leav the show mid set becaus i don't want the band to think i'm not enjoy the perform i apolog for the length of the post and if i got ani of the technic terminolog wrong i'm not a train sound guy the most i did wa some veri basic work of a power mix while i wa run an open mic/jam night for a coupl of year though i did learn a lot in that time thank for ani input you guy and gal might offer,concerned about potential for hearing loss a audience member and performer at concert until i'm able to afford a wireless iem system is it possible to buy custom ear plug that block out or quiet the most harmful frequencies/sound level while still allowing for adequate listening/monitoring warning long post i'm hoping to start a proper band project and start playing bar gig but i'm very concerned about the potential for hearing loss i attend bar show on a weekly basis sometimes twice a week but the one thing well apart from the tendency to get pulled into excessively late night and too much drinking that really drive me nut is the loudness of basically every single concert i attend there's absolutely nothing i can do about this since every guitarist want to blast their amp to  which i absolutely understand a a guitarist myself ego is a hell of a drug but also because most of these bar space are pretty small and even without the live sound running through the speaker the sound in that enclosed space is deafening what i'm wondering is if there are custom ear plug that can be purchased that might allow me to block out the more oppressive sound level and frequency to preserve my hearing yet still allow me to hear enough of what i need to hear for enjoyment of concert and monitoring myself and my bandmates a a performer playing on stage at these venue later this year i have noticed one of the long term musician in the scene wearing what appear to be custom made ear plug that he ha around his neck on a string that he wear at concert i can only presume that they are built in such a way that he can still almost fully enjoy the music at show and hear what he need to hear while protecting his hearing doe anyone here have any advice they could give me on such type of ear plug i imagine i might need to see an audiologist for these if they exist and they will cost in the  but i'm definitely willing to spend say   on something like this if can potentially preserve my hearing and let me keep playing and listening to music for the rest of my life question about custom ear plug and/or iems while performing my understanding at the moment is that some sort of wireless iem system would be the way to go for protecting my ear yet still being able to hear what i need to hear while performing i do have a pair of shure se210s and se110s though it look like it would still cost another  cad to get the whole wireless monitoring system which i can't really afford at the moment therefore i'm wondering if the sort of custom ear plug mentioned above might allow me to protect my hearing while playing live yet still let enough sound through to adequately monitor thing though i get that this might not be possible since iems would actually allow sound to come through the earbuds to let me hear thing whereas ear plug would just block out sound nevertheless it would be interesting to see if there is some sort of middle ground between doing nothing and spending  for a wireless iem system on that note since i already do have a couple set of shure iems is it at all possible to build some kind of semi portable wired monitoring system that i could use on stage maybe involving using a little cheap super basic behringer type  or  channel mixer that i could have on stage with me and connect to the iems i know the main issue would be with trying to connect my mixer to the 'monitor sends' from the main mixing board at the venue and of course that might not be practical to run some  foot cable from the sound guy's board all the way to the stage for me to use for monitoring however a at some local dedicated music venue they do already seem to have some kind of long cable run a 'snake' linking the stage to the soundboard where there are some  input jack available for the guitarist to plug their guitar into that connect to the board b with these guitar input jack there are also long speaker wire run connecting to some monitor speaker on the stage that performer use to hear themselves with this kind of setup would it be theoretically possible to have the  inch speaker wire or maybe a super long  audio cable run from the sound guy's booth that i could connect into a little cheap mini mixer i have on stage next to me that i can plug my shure iems into so i can listen to both myself and the 'house mix' of all the other instrument in my band while dialing in my own monitor mix right there on stage also with this kind of hypothetical setup could i incorporate some kind of limiter or compressor or noise reducing system that could protect my ear from any sudden spike in volume coming from the sound guy's board would a guitar noise reducer or compressor pedal work for that or would i need something more specialized a bad a loud volume already are at concert i can't imagine anything worse for hearing that a sudden surge in volume or feedback that run directly through my iems into my eardrum that's a terrifying prospect to consider there are musician friend i know who are incredibly talented yet quite a bit younger than me who have already suffered considerable hearing loss meanwhile i know there are even some veteran sound guy who have suffered hearing loss significantly which can't help with their job either i wa at  bar show in the last week alone and while i took break during the first two for the last one i toughed it out because i wa really into the performer which is what i've typically done up til now but i regret it already a soon a i walked outside midway through the last show my ear felt like they were completely clogged and underwater and i had mild tinnitus for a good half hour after the pain i feel in my ear from the cranked guitar and amp is almost immediate and i try to sit further back from the stage though this doesn't do much in small bar i also try to take regular break because i can't stand the veritable onslaught of sound i'll sometimes feel a bit queasy over how loud thing are though then i feel bad for leaving the show mid set because i don't want the band to think i'm not enjoying the performance i apologize for the length of the post and if i got any of the technical terminology wrong i'm not a trained sound guy the most i did wa some very basic working of a powered mixed while i wa running an open mic/jam night

1894,advic on buy a new set of microphon my experi so i work both in  and in a studio and i'm current invest in my first set of microphon i borrow a few small diaphragm condens and personali a/b test them but all of my other assumpt are made base on a big bunch of youtub a/b comparison between mic so befor i buy i would like to hear if you would agre with what i heard pleas read my descript of the mic i'm interest in and just comment do you hear what i hear or you heard someth differ from these mic  condens overhead mic primarili so from a friend i got an offer to buy a stereo pair of se electron s1a microphon for an amaz price less then  dollar a pair i also borrow a sennheis e614 an akg c430 and an audio technica ath450 the ath is  euro each e614 anc c430 and  euro each and the s1a are obvious by far the cheapest my person test show that the e614 ha the flattest respons and the most natur sound it ha a slight midrang bump but i would pick it over the other for captur the entir kit or an instrument like an acoust guitar/violin the c430 wasn't veri natur there is a weird midrang bump didn't like it the ath wa a bit more open sound then the e614 less midrang more air but it cost twice as much and i don't think it' worth the differ the s1a have a slight boost abov  and are flat below  which to me seem like they are amaz as overhead mic sinc i get a great cymbal sound from them and i can add the midrang and definit from the closem consid the price of the use s1a' my plan wa to buy them instead of the other option i would later add anoth pair of more midrangi condend to the mic bag  kickdrum mic long stori short i don't like the rel flat respons of the mic like the akg d112 and the ev re  i know they are more natur but that' usual not what i'm look for with kickdrum sound and they make me eq a lot the beta  and the audix d6 for my tast are a one trick poni they both have an overli agress curv that can be great for metal but whenev i want anyth a bit more rock sound and more natur their boost and scoop are simpli too much and i can't fix that with an eq the sennheis e602 ii wa a winner for me here it also ha a pre eq curv that boost sub frequenc and the beater sound but it' more natur and not as agres plu there is no sharp  bump like with the beta  i can get the   smack from it that i can't get from a  becaus it onli give me the click and make the kickdrum sound a bit like a black metal trigger the newer e902 ha a flatter curv that i would like for a bass amp but not for a kickdrum so i wa go to but an e602 ii what do you think about what i heard  tom the md421 is to expens and not veri function for live use i like both the e604 and the e904 from the test i heard and from my experi but i'm not veri certain that the e904 can be call an overal better microphon it' just differ it clean up highmid compar to the e604 becaus it ha a more broad hi mid boost but it take away more of the below  materi and make lower tune floortom sound empti in short i don't think the e904 is better i think it' differ and for tom it seem to me i would in mani case prefer the  to the  but i like the metal build of the e904 and sometim i can use the extra  click i get from the  snare and smaller tom i can't make a decis here need advic i would buy  tom mic  guitar  so  is a classic a huge hi mid boost that add definit to the guitar and that can sometim be great so i will have one in my bag beyer m201tg the complet contrast to the  which i still consid amaz for the guitar is the beyerdynam m201tg much flatter curv slight mid boost at   rich lowmid i love it i would use it when a want a warmer tone that' not go to be ear pierc and overli defin senn e906 the best balanc between the two so unlik the beyer which is quiet flat the  ha a midrang bump but at about   and it' a lot milder then the  so it add definit to the guitar but it doesn't cover up the around  midrang by boost   a thousand db like a  it seem to me to be the best option when the guitar amp sound amaz and i don't want to alter it' sound i would now buy the e906 and later a  the beyer it seem to me i can cover all base with there  veri differ microphon  vocal  let' take the  as a standard and compar to it sennheis e835 seem to be on pair with a  slightli differ curv better for some vocal wors for some other vocal sennheis e935 damn amaz more defin and natur mid then a  worth the  euro pricetag fantast overal balanc i wa plan on buy a e835  pack or some  cheap both seem good and buy one e945 for fanci concert sinc i wouldn't give it to a punk singer,advice on buying a new set of microphone my experience so i work both in  and in a studio and i'm currently investing in my first set of microphone i borrowed a few small diaphragm condenser and personaly a/b tested them but all of my other assumption are made based on a big bunch of youtube a/b comparison between mics so before i buy i would like to hear if you would agree with what i heard please read my description of the mics i'm interested in and just comment do you hear what i hear or you heard something different from these mics  condenser overhead mics primarily so from a friend i got an offer to buy a stereo pair of se electronics s1a microphone for an amazing price le then  dollar a pair i also borrowed a sennheiser e614 an akg c430 and an audio technica ath450 the

it the ath wa a bit more open sounding then the e614 le midrange more air but it cost twice a much and i don't think it's worth the difference the s1a have a slight boost above  and are flat below  which to me seemed like they are amazing a overhead mics since i get a great cymbal sound from them and i can add the midrange and definition from the closemics considering the price of the used s1a's my plan wa to buy them instead of the other option i would later add another pair of more midrangy condenders to the mic bag  kickdrum mics long story short i don't like the relatively flat response of the mics like the akg d112 and the ev re  i know they are more natural but that's usually not what i'm looking for with kickdrum sound and they make me eq a lot the beta  and the audix d6 for my taste are a one trick pony they both have an overly agressive curve that can be great for metal but whenever i want anything a bit more rock sound and more natural their boost and scoop are simply too

very functional for live use i like both the e604 and the e904 from the test i heard and from my experience but i'm not very certain that the e904 can be called an overall better microphone it's just different it clean up highmids compared to the e604 because it ha a more broad hi mid boost but it take away more of the below  material and make lower tuned floortoms sound empty in short i don't
