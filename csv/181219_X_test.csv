experi with home record and have done live sound a few time but i m veri green i think i have ok ear and am a bit of an audiophil and i usual pay attent to a mix even when casual listen to music setup 1 mixer allen heath qu 16 2 two wedg floor monitor forget the brand but they re 15 with horn and sound ok 3 monitor are use for vocal guitar one direct from model other mic ed from small amp and key direct stereo 4 bass play straight through larg bass amp 5 drum are not mic ed what work 1 the space is comfort with carpet and acoust treatment on the wall ceil are high 10 or so 2 drum riser is good give us nice face to face visibl 3 awesom mixer decent monitor 4 we religi record and review each rehears to hear what s go on i ll post some sampl after we get some obviou thing dial in not worth listen to right now 5 bandmat are cool we re all in thi for fun we re all old and so no ego stuff happen i mention thi becaus they ll be more open to experi vs have a hotshot guitar player who need to be max volum all the time what doesn t work 1 wish we could get rid of some of the furnitur and spread out more but it s not our space 2 we usual play way too loudli and it s one of those thing where we start out loud and get super loud by the end i took a measur one day with a proper meter and we were close to 110db room volum and that wasn t our loudest 3 i play guitar and usual can t hear myself even though i m right in front of the monitor thi is appar in our record too in fact over the two month that we ve been togeth we ll cycl between bass too loud drum too loud key too loud etc setup question 1 should we mic the kick drum and if so is a fanci drum mic necessari or can we use an old sm57/58 for now 2 should we run the bass direct and if so do we need a di box or can we plug straight into the board reason for not do thi is fatigu the monitor and also the bass amp sound cool and veri full through the amp 3 floor wedg are angl toward the center given our small space should we aim these straight back so those of us who stand off axi can hear more 4 ani tip for reduc room volum and what is an ideal room volum anyway tough convers to have as everyon want to use the time to rock out and let off steam but when we play so loudli it s imposs to hear each other and everyth is a mush of sound plu not at all good for our ear we wear plug but still mix build 1 what are the standard do thi everi time or never do thi thing e g don't turn yourself up without check with other becaus mayb the rest can turn down 2 from other repli it sound like i should start with the drum then bring bass to similar volum then guitar then key final vocal 3 is it correct that when set level that everyon play at max patch volum and then onli dial back for quiet part of a song right now i think the bass player back off hi volum knob ye i know it s realli a gain knob for sound check and then up it later on for boost which is probabl never dial back i suspect key are do the same i set all my level clean dirti the same and then sound check with my normal dirti patch i have a special boost patch a few db higher just for lead other guitar player ha clean patch quieter than dirti one what kind of ground rule should we have here 4 right now i stupidli have everyon play/s an e chord and tri to quickli dial in level in 20 second i know thi is wrong but what s better should we alway start with the same song and have me adjust as we go through it or start layer on top of the e chord one by one 5 i current pan my guitar a littl more toward me and the other guitar more toward him just so we hear a littl more of ourselv is thi normal/ok to do 6 given our setup is it safe to assum that everyon should be abl to hear everyon somewhat clearli if we get room volum and mix set correctli or will it alway be the case where the drummer can t hear the key for exampl 7 how much should i be tweak while we rehears i want to focu on the song way more than the mix so don t want to be distracted/distract by constantli fiddl but i think it need to be more than the total of 60 second that i m give it now 8 i m assum that if we work on get our rehears mix dial in better then it

735,disappear width hey guy late i'v been realli tri to learn to get my mix wider and in particular my electr guitar track i recent start play with a trick i learn onlin to just put a stereo delay on a mono guitar track either a signal design stereo delay plugin or ya know make a mono copi hard pan both and then delay one with a sampl delay thi sound good i mean in a mix it sound cool and i could go full blown width at like 180 degre with plenti of room in the middl or i can throw a direct mixer on and reign it in a bit toward like 70 max width on these delay signal either way it wa cool and then i start feed that into a nice stereo hall reverb it sound nice but then just to check the mix i put a direct mixer on the stereo output and made it all mono the volum of thi orign mono guitar track drop drastic wherea other mono element in the mix did not which proport made them seem way louder and sort of ruin the whole balanc i understand thi ha to do with phase cancel right so i am deal with thi becaus it wa origin a mono sourc sound so i have to heavili modifi the hard pan or almost hard pan edit to get them not to be so similar to each other that i get cancel i realli would just like advic on deal with thi problem that i creat for instanc how would you make those two signal 'differ enough' so i don't lose them sum in mono is it pitch correct up and down a few cent each or longer delay between each rn i have like a 10 ms and a 20 ms delay respect but also sort of go back to my origin issu what do you guy do to give a nice wide aspect to a guitar track thi problem came up becaus i am better at guitar than piano i record a track that i want to have the rhythm chang and harmoni carri by an elect guitar mostli thi is tricki becaus it seem so natur mono to me wherea someth like a synth or electr piano carri the harmoni and play the chord progress natur lend itself to a nice wide stereo imag am i think about thi all right i alway feel like i have a decent understand of stereo signal path until i think too hard about it then my understand seem to disappear and i start question myself is thi cancel out is thi two hard pan mono sourc or a singl stereo sourc from my yamaha dx7 hardwar synth are logic x' stock e piano sound two hard pan mono or is there a middl portion to the 'image' of the sound and if so if i put a m/ processor on there and suck out the side am i left with a combin of the two side with a differ time delay etc etc i just sort of think myself in circl and start to feel dumb second guess myself i'd realli appreci ani insight that get me closer to a confid understand of how to add width to 'chord' or harmon instrument track and the abil to call upon thi skillset when i need it instead of just sort of guess and check with differ combin of delay and multi track thank,disappearing width hey guy lately i've been really trying to learn to get my mix wider and in particular my electric guitar track i recently started playing with a trick i learned online to just put a stereo delay on a mono guitar track either a signal designated stereo delay plugin or ya know making a mono copy hard panning both and then delaying one with a sample delay this sounded good i mean in a mix it sounded cool and i could go full blown width at like 180 degree with plenty of room in the middle or i can throw a directional mixer on and reign it in a bit towards like 70 max width on these delayed signal either way it wa cool and then i started feeding that into a nice stereo hall reverb it sounded nice but then just to check the mix i put a directional mixer on the stereo output and made it all mono the volume of this orignally mono guitar track dropped drastically whereas other mono element in the mix did not which proportionally made them seem way louder and sort of ruined the whole balance i understand this ha to do with phase cancellation right so i am dealing with this because it wa originally a mono source sound so i have to heavily modify the hard panned or almost hard panned edits to get them not to be so similar to each other that i get cancellation i really would just like advice on dealing with this problem that i created for instance how would you make those two signal 'different enough' so i don't lose them summed in mono is it pitch correction up and down a few cent each or longer delay between each rn i have like a 10 m and a 20 m delay respectively but also sort of going back to my original issue what do you guy do to give a nice wide aspect to a guitar track this problem came up because i am better at guitar than piano i recorded a track that i wanted to have the rhythm change and harmony carried by an electic guitar mostly this is tricky because it seems so naturally mono to me whereas something like a synth or electric piano carrying the harmony and playing the chord progression naturally lends itself to a nice wide stereo image am i thinking about this all right i always feel like i have a decent understanding of stereo signal path until i think too hard about it then my understanding seems to disappear and i start questioning myself is this cancelling out is this two hard panned mono source or a single stereo source from my yamaha dx7 hardware synth are logic x's stock e piano sound two hard panned mono or is there a middle portion to the 'image' of the sound and if so if i put a m/s processor on there and suck out the side am i left with a combination of the two side with a different time delay etc etc i just sort of think myself in circle and start to feel dumb second guess myself i'd really appreciate any insight that get me closer to a confident understanding of how to add width to 'chord' or harmonic instrument track and the ability to call upon this skillset when i need it instead of just sort of guessing and checking with different combination of delay and multi tracking thanks

to share and there' a coupl of thing i found thought provok as it' my first time work with thi particular product these box come with onboard dsp that allow hpf eq delay and eleven preset tune here' a nifti anim show how each of the preset compar to the raw respons 1/12 oct smooth http //imgur com/v74daw9 http //imgur com/v74daw9 to address the obviou question no it' not a flat line i measur the loudspeak in the real world where it' go to be use not in a lab rather than the line itself what i'm point out here is the differ in each of the preset i person find the gain reduct on some of these preset rather alarm i would have assum that the tune simpli chang the eq curv but a hand of these have pretti sever attenu as well i'd be interest to know what the think wa behind these decis if you'r a system tech you probabl are extrem skeptic of tune preset like these my view on thi is more philosoph than technic if you'r a musician and you just want to plug in and play use whatev preset you think sound the best that' clearli where qsc is go with these preset as an engin howev i feel that eq' the entir system for a specif input is a big no no each eq ha a job and we don't want to get the wire cross i use input eq for input i use loudspeak eq to manag the loudspeak in the space for more on thi approach see thi articl http //www prosoundweb com/channels/church/eq boot camp a regiment approach to effect equalization/ and thi video by dave rat http //www youtub com/watch v cu9bmupc62c now practic if that' all you have at your dispos obvious you want to use it but i tri to adher to strict eq disciplin whenev possibl which keep thing nice and organ and pay off in spade on larger more complex system the bigger and more practic issu is that i don't want to use a preset unless i understand what it' do to my signal thi is the big distinct between the artist and the technic it' perfectli accept in my view for an artist to be ignor of what' happen under the hood as long as they'r get the desir result not so for an engin anoth good exampl of thi is an enhanc plugin or ani sort of magic black box process lot of these exist they all claim to make it sound better but don't elabor on how if you'r a musician and you want to use it for artist reason becaus you like the way it sound go nut but as a system tech i have full respons for the signal chain and everyth in it so if i can't tell you what the devic is do to my signal i'm not go to put it in the signal chain thi isn't about condemn certain product it' about educ myself about what those product do and then make an inform decis as to whether or not it' appropri in the situat in thi specif applic the box in question are destin for use as low profil monitor in a small okay tini club here' how the two stage monitor eq preset affect the respons http //imgur com/fcnb3kk http //imgur com/fcnb3kk yike i'm concern about the gain reduct and i'm not particularli excit about the 1k and 12k peak either but my primarli concern lie with the low end these are small format monitor mostli for vocal on a small loud stage so we certainli don't need all the lf respons when there are larg subwoof a few feet away i want to reduc the lf buildup from the floor coupl but not mangl the respons complet in gener i'll shoot for a highpass rolloff around 100 hz i'm not in love with either of the preset so i figur i'd roll my own time to reset the dsp and start from scratch look at the 100 hz and 125 hz option for the onboard highpass filter http //imgur com/kauvdvd i didn't realli like either of them the 125 hz set purpl trace roll off too high to support the vocal fundament and the 100 hz set light blue is probabl close enough but i'd rather split the differ addit i don't like that bump around 600 hz i wa abl to creat thi respons http //imgur com/xcejqxo use a combin of a lo shelf 2 db 200 hz and a 100 hz hpf along with a parametr cut at 200 hz 2 db q 0 7 now the lf is more of a mesa and less of a hump and i'm still a comfort way down by 80 hz anoth 2 db filter at 800 q 0 5 tame that midrang bump that would have sound unpleas with most vocal mic the instal itself is go to have to happen in a veri small time window becaus the club ha schedul event so my strategi wa to get thing as close to dial in as possibl while still at the shop onc i get into the room next week i should be in the ballpark onli need to adjust for the effect of the specif acoust environ a theme in common with my previou post note that we don't need a ton of eq to get result the filter are wide and gentl noth crazi here in conclus i would say that preset can be handi timesav if they work for you whenev possibl befor use one i'd like to confirm for myself exactli what it' do,between the line 4 preset v reset howdy y'all preparing some of the new qsc k 2 series box for a club install and have some data here from the verification step of the process i thought it wa interesting enough to share and there's a couple of thing i found thought provoking a it's my first time working with this particular product these box come with onboard dsp that allows hpf eq delay and eleven preset tuning here's a nifty animation showing how each of the presets compare to the raw response 1/12 oct smoothing http //imgur com/v74daw9 http //imgur com/v74daw9 to address the obvious question no it's not a flat line i measured the loudspeaker in the real world where it's going to be used not in a lab rather than the line itself what i'm pointing out here is the difference in each of the presets i personally find the gain reduction on some of these presets rather alarming i would have assumed that the tuning simply changed the eq curve but a handful of these have pretty severe attenuation a well i'd be interested to know what the thinking wa behind these decision if you're a system tech you probably are extremely skeptical of tuning presets like these my view on this is more philosophical than technical if you're a musician and you just want to plug in and play use whatever preset you think sound the best that's clearly where qsc is going with these presets a an engineer however i feel that eq'ing the entire system for a specific input is a big no no each eq ha a job and we don't want to get the wire crossed i use input eq for input i use loudspeaker eq to manage the loudspeaker in the space for more on this approach see this article http //www prosoundweb com/channels/church/eq boot camp a regimented approach to effective equalization/ and this video by dave rat http //www youtube com/watch v cu9bmupc62c now practically if that's all you have at your disposal obviously you want to use it but i try to adhere to strict eq discipline whenever possible which keep thing nice and organized and pay off in spade on larger more complex system the bigger and more practical issue is that i don't want to use a preset unless i understand what it's doing to my signal this is the big distinction between the artistic and the technical it's perfectly acceptable in my view for an artist to be ignorant of what's happening under the hood a long a they're getting the desired result not so for an engineer another good example of this is an enhancer plugin or any sort of magic black box process lot of these exist they all claim to make it sound better but don't elaborate on how if you're a musician and you want to use it for artistic reason because you like the way it sound go nut but a a system tech i have full responsibility for the signal chain and everything in it so if i can't tell you what the device is doing to my signal i'm not going to put it in the signal chain this isn't about condemning certain product it's about educating myself about what those product do and then making an informed decision a to whether or not it's appropriate in the situation in this specific application the box in question are destined for use a low profile monitor in a small okay tiny club here's how the two stage monitor eq presets affect the response http //imgur com/fcnb3kk http //imgur com/fcnb3kk yikes i'm concerned about the gain reduction and i'm not particularly excited about the 1k and 12k peak either but my primarly concern lie with the low end these are small format monitor mostly for vocal on a small loud stage so we certainly don't need all the lf response when there are large subwoofer a few foot away i want to reduce the lf buildup from the floor coupling but not mangle the response completely in general i'll shoot for a highpass rolloff around 100 hz i'm not in

that would have sounded unpleasant with most vocal mics the install itself is going to have to happen in a very small time window because the club ha scheduled event so my strategy wa to get thing a close to dialed in a possible while still at the shop once i get into the room next week i should be in the ballpark only needing to adjust for the effect of the specific acoustic environment a theme in common with my previous post note that we don't need a ton of eq to get result the filter are wide and gentle nothing crazy here in conclusion i would say that presets can be handy timesavers if they work for you whenever possible before using one i'd like to confirm for myself exactly what it's doing

the band is consid a big jump into better speaker as we'r start to pick up show we'r still stuck between a few speaker yamaha dsr qsc k12 2 along with a sub still look around the fact stand that these are huge invest for us to be honest i do not know much on how to maintain speaker and make them last / i want to make sure when we buy the speaker that the band ha a gener educ on safeti speaker so you know the head doesn't blow out at the veri least i understand that make sure mixer is turn off when no one is play in case a player unplug their instrument cabl minim feedback don't overdr speaker and leav headroom here are my questions/concern 1 sinc i'm look at power speaker what doe watt and ohm have to do with activ speaker i keep read that under power amp can clip the amp but if i'm use power speaker where do amp watt and ohm play into thi i think thi is more of an issu for passiv speaker 2 with the speaker i'v use in the past i'v had to push my fader to the max and gain on the speaker for some outdoor event in hindsight i might have been push the speaker to the limit leav littl headroom is there a way to reduc that i'm more concern about sound output for some event that are outdoor and less than 500 peopl with the dsr or qsc k12 2s i don't think sound output is an issu so i wouldn't need to push my fader and speaker to the max 3 for smaller event should i still use the dsrs/qsc or should i tri to ask the venue/friend if they have smaller one my concern is use the speaker too much could caus them to wear down not sure if that is a correct assumpt 4 how import is the warranti do speaker break down easili if i could get them on ebay/refurbish for cheaper rather than through an author seller with warranti i would to save a few hundr dollar speaker seem kinda fragil to me and i don't want to damag a high invest item compar to comput which are more meant to be overclock it seem like push speaker to their limit will kill it i want to be abl to utilize/optim the speaker to their fullest potenti but leav headroom seem to be more ideal ani more tip and common mistak you see from djs/audio engin hand speaker are greatli appreci for someon who will soon be the owner of expens ass for us speaker tl dr about to own speaker for the first time i need some advic and tip so i don't bust them,looking to upgrade speaker soon need some advice on maintenance and safety tip i've been using the peavy pr12 yamaha dxrs and mackie thump in the past for the band never really owned speaker i've looked around and the band is considering a big jump into better speaker a we're starting to pick up show we're still stuck between a few speaker yamaha dsrs qsc k12 2 along with a sub still looking around the fact stand that these are huge investment for u to be honest i

out at the very least i understand that make sure mixer is turned off when no one is playing in case a player unplugs their instrument cable minimize feedback don't overdrive speaker and leave headroom here are my questions/concerns 1 since i'm looking at powered speaker what doe watt and ohm have to do with active speaker i keep reading that under powered amp can clip the amp but if i'm using powered speaker where do amp watt and ohm play into this i think this is more of an issue for passive speaker 2 with the speaker i've used in the past i've had to push my faders to the max and gain on the speaker for some outdoor event in hindsight i might have been pushed the speaker to the limit leaving little headroom is there a way to reduce that i'm more concerned about sound output for some event that are outdoors and le than 500 people with the dsrs or qsc k12 2 i don't think sound output is an issue so i wouldn't need to push my faders and speaker to the max 3 for smaller event should i still use the dsrs/qscs or should i try to ask the venue/friends if they have smaller one my concern is using the speaker too much could cause them to wear down not sure if that is a correct assumption 4 how important is the warranty do speaker break down easily if i could get them on ebay/refurbished for cheaper rather than through an authorized seller with warranty i would to save a few hundred dollar speaker seem kinda fragile to me and i don't want to damage a high investment item compared to computer which are more meant to be overclocked it seems like pushing speaker to their limit will kill it i want to be able to utilize/optimize the speaker to their fullest potential but leaving headroom seems to be more ideal any more tip and common mistake you see from djs/audio engineer handing speaker are greatly appreciated for someone who will soon be the owner of expensive as for u speaker tl dr about to own speaker for the first time i need some advice and tip so i don't bust them
1249,between the line 3 how to find line array splay angl i know i know i just post i'm prepar a powerpoint present so i figur i'd kill two bird with one stone after thi post i'll shut up for a while when prepar the configur of a line array technic an asymmetr composit coupl point sourc i start with three piec of inform 1 what is the desir coverag angl from the loudspeaker' point of view the angl from the last row to the front row 2 what is the rang ratio how far the top box need to throw to the last coverag row divid by how far the bottom box need to throw to the first coverag row 3 how mani box are in the hang and what splay angl set are avail in the exampl i'v made up the coverag angl is about 45 and i'v given myself a budget of 12 box http //imgur com/fk1kigp http //imgur com/fk1kigp the absolut throw distanc are not nearli as import as the relationship between them in thi case it' 2 9 time farther to the last seat than the first seat let' start with a big ole' constant curvatur sourc and just cover the angl 12 box at 4 splay give us 48 of coverag http //imgur com/rcmo0yn http //imgur com/rcmo0yn i didn't take the time to add big bold line for the coverag line but you can clearli see the seat shape the gif anim show the predict on octav center from 250 hz to 8 khz thi is a symmetr array that creat a complet symmetr coverag pattern note that due to the symmetri we know that the geometr center of thi array between box 6 and 7 is on axi onax for all frequenc that seem obviou now but file it away the problem is that the desir coverag area is not symmetr everyon will hear the show but the folk in the front are go to hear it about 9 db louder than the folk in the back we know thi thank to the invers squar law for a rang ratio of 2 9 20log 2 9/1 9 db what about autosplay the softwar give angl of 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 6 6 that' 11 angl becaus it' 12 box zero degre splay caus a whole bunch of problem but what i'd like to focu on here is the problem that auto splay present for tri to eq the array the onaxi onax mic posit is the mainstay of the eq process and thi is where we run into problem where is onax http //imgur com/p0iuf0a http //imgur com/p0iuf0a the main coverag lobe the loudest point along the coverag angl now shift over frequenc whi thi happen is not a quick explan but it ha to do with the amount of direct control the array as a whole and the individu box can exert over differ wavelength as frequenc fall wavelength get longer and the direct in which the box is point matter less and less the takeaway here is that we no longer have anywher to place the refer mic that is repres of the array as a whole and thu no firm basi on which to make effect eq decis thi is not the fault of autosplay rather it' the consequ of have an asymmetr array shape creat by autosplay so let' skip the autosplay and come up with our own splay angl the follow is heavili base on the mccarthi / meyer approach with a few littl adapt of my own for the full stori read bob' book http //www amazon com/sound system optim techniqu alignment/dp/0415731011/ref sr_1_1 ie utf8 qid 1542162504 sr 8 1 keyword bob mccarthi sound system design and optim the idea behind an articul line array is that we can use overlap coverag of adjac box to creat summat and offset the level varianc we need more level toward the back so we want more overlap toward the top of the array how much more rang ratio wa 3 1 so let' use three time as much overlap at the top put anoth way a ratio of 1 3 between the angl at the top and bottom of the array in theori thi offset the rang ratio although thi is one of the area where i depart from bob mccarthy' guidelin i find that a splay ratio 30 50 larger reduc the amount of shade i need later if we divid the array into composit and we keep each composit symmetr we can solo each section of the array and know exactli where onax is for all frequenc no differ than work with a singl loudspeak then we just combin them and use eq to compens for the combin effect name lf buildup and we'r good to go the top composit need to go further so in gener they should consist of more box at smaller splay angl out of my 12 box i did four composit a b c and d there' a littl guess test and revis base on the angl your particular system can actual hit but let' go with a 4 box 2 for a total of 8 b 3 2 for a total of 6 c 3 4 for a total of 12 and final d 2 8 for a total of 16 that give me a grand total of 42 of coverag plu the fring that extend past the onax of the topmost and bottommost box there' no magic here just keep push and pull and obey the guidelin of fewer box per composit at larger angl as we go down when we translat that into interbox angl which we need to give the softwar and the rigger we get 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 4 6 8 the parenthes indic interbox angl within each composit a for exampl ha 4 box and therefor three interbox angl and the transit splay angl between composit are visibl between the group anoth brilliant convent of bob' that we can't fulli dive into here the trend are observ fewer box at wider splay as we go down and the bottom splay is 4 time the top splay so we'v more than offset the rang ratio each symmetr element then ha a clearli defin onax at all frequenc allow us to place a mic and appli equal the anim show the frequenc rang for each composit segment in turn http //imgur com/efwatco http //imgur com/efwatco the comput took the liberti of rescal the color key for each frequenc which is annoy but the gener concept is clearli visibl the combin eq process is tricki http //www prosoundweb com/channels/study_hall/choos your battl examin dispers pattern control in line arrays/ and i won't get into it here but onc we put everyth togeth we can achiev extrem even coverag http //imgur com/uhjaaf http //imgur com/uhjaaf the lf lobe will still radiat from the geometr center of the array sinc the wavelength are so long the few degre of splay are practic ignor some platform allow a littl all pass steer here but even without it we have a veri well behav pa system one last note it' a bit hot down in front so after do what we can with splay a littl shade can go a long way take the bottom two composit bottom 5 box down by 3 db result in an even lower varianc coverag scenario http //imgur com/ocptjrh http //imgur com/ocptjrh befor we head to cater let' address the shade issu there' sometim a concern about how much headroom is lost by turn some of the box down the box have the most overlap at lf so that' where the largest potenti loss would occur in thi case take 5 out of 12 box down by 3 db creat a loss of just over 1 db of lf headroom noth to be scare of,between the line 3 how to find line array splay angle i know i know i just posted i'm preparing a powerpoint presentation so i figured i'd kill two bird with one stone after this post i'll shut up for a while when preparing the configuration of a line array technically an asymmetrical composite coupled point source i start with three piece of information 1 what is the desired coverage angle from the loudspeaker's point of view the angle from the last row to the front row 2 what is the range ratio how far the top box need to throw to the last coverage row divided by how far the bottom box need to throw to the first coverage row 3 how many box are in the hang and what splay angle setting are available in the example i've made up the coverage angle is about 45 and i've given myself a budget of 12 box http //imgur com/fk1kigp http //imgur com/fk1kigp the absolute throw distance are not nearly a important a the relationship between them in this case it's 2 9 time farther to the last seat than the first seat let's start with a big ole' constant curvature source and just cover the angle 12 box at 4 splay give u 48 of coverage http //imgur com/rcmo0yn http //imgur com/rcmo0yn i didn't take the time to add big bold line for the coverage line but you can clearly see the seating shape the gif animates showing the prediction on octave center from 250 hz to 8 khz this is a symmetrical array that creates a completely symmetrical coverage pattern note that due to the symmetry we know that the geometrical center of this array between box 6 and 7 is on axis onax for all frequency that seems obvious now but file it away the problem is that the desired coverage area is not symmetrical everyone will hear the show but the folk in the front are going to hear it about 9 db louder than the folk in the back we know this thanks to the inverse squared law for a range ratio of 2 9 20log 2 9/1 9 db what about autosplay the software give angle of 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 6 6 that's 11 angle because it's 12 box zero degree splay cause a whole bunch of problem but what i'd like to focus on here is the problem that auto splay present for trying to eq the array the onaxis onax mic position is the mainstay of the eq process and this is where we run into problem where is onax http //imgur com/p0iuf0a http //imgur com/p0iuf0a the main coverage lobe the loudest point along the coverage angle now shift over frequency why this happens is not a quick explanation but it ha to do with the amount of directional control the array a a whole and the individual box can exert over different wavelength a frequency fall wavelength get longer and the direction in which the box is pointed matter le and le the takeaway here is that we no longer have anywhere to place the reference mic that is representative of the array a a whole and thus no firm basis on which to make effective eq decision this is not the fault of autosplay rather it's the consequence of having an asymmetrical array shape created by autosplay so let's skip the autosplay and come up with our own splay angle the following is heavily based on the mccarthy / meyer approach with a few little adaptation of my own for the full story read bob's book http //www amazon com/sound system optimization technique alignment/dp/0415731011/ref sr_1_1 ie utf8 qid 1542162504 sr 8 1 keywords bob mccarthy sound system design and optimization the idea behind an articulated line array is that we can use overlapping coverage of adjacent box to create summation and offset the level variance we need more level towards the back so we want more overlap towards the top of the array how much more range ratio wa 3 1 so let's use three time a much overlap at the top put another way a ratio of 1 3 between the angle at the top and bottom of the array in theory this offset the range ratio although this is one of the area where i depart from bob mccarthy's guideline i find that a splay ratio 30 50 larger reduces the amount of shading i need later if we divide the array into composite and we keep each composite symmetrical we can solo each

16x4 rapco 100 snake thi system ha serv me well for mani year those speaker are 20 year old and they have proven to be incred durabl workhors but i know i can do better here is what i am look to get as an upgrad behring x32 rack to replac the xr12 for small gig and doubl as a stage box for the full x32 2x turbosound iq12 main 4x turbosound iq10 monitor i m go to do thi a piec at a time so my plan is to get a coupl iq10 s and start use them as main for my weekli open mic gig and eventu get a coupl more iq10 s for monitor and final the x32 rack the x32 rack will give me more option for smaller gig the xr12 onli ha 4 mic pre s and it can act as a stage box for my x32 consol elimin the need for the multicor snake then eventu i may add either two more iq10 or iq12 s see below i can also use ultranet to connect the speaker which cut down on cabl and simplifi everyth daisychain for the win i cannot seem to find ani tandem powercon/cat5 cabl so i guess i will have to make my own but that s not a big deal look at the spec of the iq10 s vs the iq12 s there isn t all that much differ i do sound reinforc mostli for acoust band and my current yamaha speaker have never fail to play loud enough the iq10 s play louder and lower than my current 12 speaker my current speaker are rate down to onli 60hz 10db and have a max spl of 125db while the iq10 s go to 55hz 3db with 129db max spl that is a signific differ do i even need to bother with the iq12 s i occasion do rock band and my yamaha have proven to be fine in those situat as well again the iq10 s are louder and play lower so i
