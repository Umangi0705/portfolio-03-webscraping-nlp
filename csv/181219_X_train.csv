707,logic pro parallel process latenc issu resolv sort of hi there i want to share with you a discoveri i found while do parallel process in logic pro 8 which i have a suspicion may still appli to logic 9 and x problem wa that one of the main group buss wa lag by about 50m or so than the rest of my main buss everi channel wa sent to one of 5 main group buss 1 drum 2 instrument pump with a sidechain 3 instrument i want no pump 4 bass and 5 wobbl fx buss all were output to output 1 2 except for wobbl buss and reverb buss which were both rout back to the instrument buss with sidechain and thi rout is exactli what wa caus the problem i wa abl to test thi by send a snare hit to the buss in question while simultan send to one of the other buss also test with main out and you would hear it slap twice i wa fear that perhap new york compress and other parallel process techniqu might encount issu in logic pro with latenc issu due to some architectur 'error' howev with a littl experiment i wa abl to allevi the problem the short short summari is that it seem logic may have issu with multipl aux output to eachoth rather than when they all output directli to output 1 2 aux1 instrument were sent to thi buss for process with an lfo to perform a 'wobble' filter effect serum fx gt onli send wa to aux2 for reverb and output to aux3 main instrument pump buss serum fx had a side chain input activ aux2 wave rverb gt output to aux3 main instrument pump buss aux3 main instrument buss with ssl buss compressor sidechain to a kick drum captur from aux 20 aux 3 wa lag by the 50 or so ms compar to the other aux/buss group latenc wa set to all in logic pro set so in theori compens should have been all in align but check thi out when i remov aux1' reverb send the latenc disappear likewis when i chang the output from the reverb buss aux2 from aux 3 to output 1 2 the latenc would also go away i should note when i would remov all plugin from the reverb aux thi had no effect on latenc if still output to aux 3 so we might conclud that there wa someth about two separ aux channel wobbl buss and reverb buss feed into a common 3rd aux creat delay compens issu with that particular aux channel but there more to the stori if i remov the sidechain from serum fx on aux1 the latenc disappear it didn't matter what wa go on with the reverb aux so i thought mayb thi wa all due to a flaw with serum i remov serum ad an ssl compressor to the same aux channel aux1 latenc still gone but then i ad a sidechain to the compressor and guess what latenc back and i could perform the same experi abov with the reverb channel so there wa someth about have a sidechain aux and it send ultim meet at a final common aux that will caus it to experi faulti delay compens remov either the sidechain or chang the send rout and the problem goe away weird right anyon want to chime in on what might be happen here interestingli i have not been abl to recreat thi experi all the time it seem to happen at random if i were to take a stab at what' go on here i think it ha someth to do with how the busses/aux are rout intern with logic when they are establish initi and how it relat to the delay compens algorithm perhap it depend on the order of when they are establish rout to eachoth or when the plugin are ad the list could go on and on so i would suggest be awar that these problem may happen in logic when aux are be sent to other aux and there is some sidechan go on not a common issu or scenario i'm sure but still someth to bear in mind hope thi wasn't too convolut but i invit you to repeat the experi and see if you can come up with anyth,logic pro parallel processing latency issue resolved sort of hi there i wanted to share with you a discovery i found while doing parallel processing in logic pro 8 which i have a suspicion may still apply to logic 9 and x problem wa that one of the main group bus wa lagged by about 50ms or so than the rest of my main bus every channel wa sent to one of 5 main group bus 1 drum 2 instrument pumped with a sidechain 3 instrument i wanted no pump 4 bass and 5 wobble fx bus all were outputting to output 1 2 except for wobble bus and reverb bus which were both routed back to the instrument bus with sidechain and this routing is exactly what wa causing the problem i wa able to test this by sending a snare hit to the bus in question while simultaneously sending to one of the other bus also tested with main out and you would hear it slap twice i wa fearing that perhaps new york compression and other parallel processing technique might encounter issue in logic pro with latency issue due to some architectural 'error' however with a little experimentation i wa able to alleviate the problem the short short summary is that it seems logic may have issue with multiple auxes outputting to eachother rather than when they all output directly to output 1 2 aux1 instrument were sent to this bus for processing with an lfo to perform a 'wobble' filter effect serum fx gt only send wa to aux2 for reverb and outputted to aux3 main instrumentation pump bus serum fx had a side chain input activated aux2 wave rverb gt outputted to aux3 main instrument pump bus aux3 main instrument bus with ssl bus compressor sidechained to a kick drum captured from aux 20 aux 3 wa lagging by the 50 or so m compared to the other aux/buss group latency wa set to all in logic pro setting so in theory compensation should have been all in alignment but check this out when i removed aux1's reverb send the latency disappeared likewise when i changed the output from the reverb bus aux2 from aux 3 to output 1 2 the latency would also go away i should note when i would remove all plugins from the reverb aux this had no effect on latency if still outputting to aux 3 so we might conclude that there wa something about two separate aux channel wobble bus and reverb bus feeding into a common 3rd aux creating delay compensation issue with that particular aux channel but there more to the story if i removed the sidechain from serum fx on aux1 the latency disappeared it didn't matter what wa going on with the reverb aux so i thought maybe this wa all due to a flaw with serum i removed serum added an ssl compressor to the same aux channel aux1 latency still gone but then i added a sidechain to the compressor and guess what latency back and i could perform the same experiment above with the reverb channel so there wa something about having a sidechained aux and it send ultimately meeting at a final common aux that will cause it to experience faulty delay compensation remove either the sidechain or change the send routing and the problem go away weird right anyone want to chime in on what might be happening here interestingly i have not been able to recreate this experiment all the time it seems to happen at random if i were to take a stab at what's going on here i think it ha something to do with how the busses/auxes are routed internally with logic when they are established initially and how it relates to the delay compensation algorithm perhaps it depends on the order of when they are established routed to eachother or when the plugins are added the list could go on and on so i would suggest being aware that these problem may happen in logic when auxes are being sent to other auxes and there is some sidechaning going on not a common issue or scenario i'm sure but still something to bear in mind hopefully this wasn't too convoluted but i invite you to repeat the experiment and see if you can come up with anything

thi issu i'v notic that variou player with realli big guitar sound like adam jone of tool have multi amp setup even guy like zakk wyld use a choru pedal with multipl amp to thicken their sound at the moment i have a boss dd 6 delay with stereo out and i'm look to add a boss choru pedal and boss reverb pedal with stereo out as well what i'd like to go for is an a/b/i setup so i have the option of run two amp simultan dure live perform i actual would even be interest in run three amp simultan if possibl though thi isn't absolut necessari if a three way splitter is insan expens compar to a two way a/b/i one i'm fine with stick to the two way one haul two amp to a show would probabl be enough work as it is i'v read how on album like siames dream multi tracking/lay guitar part wa a huge part of get that monstrou tone which got me think that if i rig up two or three amp to use all at onc while play live or while record i might be abl to sort of approxim that effect adam jone of tool use three amp with each one focus on handl a differ chunk of the frequenc rang or configur to creat a differ tonal gt so i ve alway play with two or three amp one for high end one that s good with midrang and one that kick in with the low or i use one that s got that good solid state metallica crunch and one that s got that warm marshal tube sound http //www guitarworld com/gw archive/dear guitar hero adam jone tool talk tone gear video band anonym time between album and more of cours in my case what i'm go for won't be anywher near the corgan esqu wall of sound deriv from stack 20 or 30 guitar track all at onc but have two amp go at onc is still a 100 increas in guitar it might also make record multipl guitar track easier and give me an interest way to get tonal varieti from record the same guitar part i could have two amp go at onc have them both mice up but have them configur differ so that while i'm play one guitar part two differ guitar tone would be gener and record and thi variat in tone could result from differ amp set or simpli by virtu of use say a solid state amp alongsid a tube amp question re splitter box and hum i have done some research and it seem that a splitter that elimin ground hum is vital http //www premierguitar com/articles/tone_stacking_with_two_amp http //www seymourduncan com/blog/th tone garage/multi amp rig 101 but i don't know anyth about thi kind of gadget i e what brand make them what price rang they usual fall in what featur to look for who make decent one that aren't crazi expens etc i'v never tri to rig up anyth thi complex are there ani a/b/i splitter box that are of decent/solid qualiti that effect elimin hum issu without be ultra expens it would be cool to run three amp at onc but if such a box is prohibit expens two amp is fine question re mice these amp dure live show and record also i wa wonder if you guy might have some input on way to mic these two amp dure live show and at home in my adam jone research i found thi inform from one of tool' engin say he would use two mic on each of jones' amp gt adam mainli run three amp he ha a marshal that he love a diezel and then he wa use a mesa boogi at one point i brought in a bogner uberschal head and a rivera knucklehead reverb and sever other thing then we just experi with combin of head and cabinet until it work for the song most of the 4 12 were mesa boogi cabinet which are superior for their low end except for the marshal head which went through a marshal cabinet and the rivera went through a rivera cabinet i usual use stock mike for me that' a shure sm57 and a sennheis 421 on everi cabinet the third mic could be anyth that i felt the sound need more of http //www guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jone tool guitar rig/ do you guy similarli recommend a combo mic setup of an sm57 and a sennheis 421 at the moment i just have one sm57 and three sm58 but at some point i might be open to get other mic what doe the 421 do that is differ from the sm57 would it make a differ in my sound while play live or just be too much unnecessari work for the sound guy question re captur three discret guitar track from three amp simultan in one take thi question might be too focus on record to be includ here so feel free to skip it i just thought i should includ it anyway sinc it is the last element i'd need to cover i have a veri basic behring xenyx 1204 4 channel mixer with a separ uca 200 rca to usb interfac that goe into my comput i'd be interest in be abl to captur separ track simultan by individu mice differ guitar amp while i play a singl take and run these mic cabl into separ channel on a mixer thi interview about adam jone' record techniqu explain what i mean gt the signal chain for track guitar wa a bit complex adam would play into whatev pedal he need barresi say that signal then went into a systemat system splitter then it would go to between three and five head the signal from the head went to their own individu cabinet each cabinet had two or three microphon on it then all the microphon came back to the consol and they were blend down as separ for each amp the diezel amp went to it own track the marshal amp went to it own track the third track wa a blend of the bogner and the rivera or whatev i like for the song and that would be one take three track of guitar http //www guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jone tool guitar rig/ in my case the problem is that when i run two or three or four mic into my mixer then out into the separ rca/usb interfac and into audac on my comput that everyth will just get mix down into one singl track is there ani way to have a mixer simultan record to multipl discret track on a comput program is the issu that my mixer doesn't have a usb output built in would i be abl to lay down multipl discret track all at onc with a differ mixer again no worri if peopl don't want to answer thi last question the other two more directli connect to livesound wherea thi is tie more to record sorri for the long post but thank in advanc you guy were incred help on my recent post ask about custom earplug for live perform so i realli valu your expertis,looking to build an a/b/y multi guitar amp rig using stereo effect pedal for live performance and recording but am concerned about ground hum anyone have suggestion for gizmo that can split a guitar signal without causing phase or hum problem question re micing this multi amp rig live long post sorry if this is a bit too guitar based of a question to be asked here but it doe concern my hope to set up a working multi amp rig for live performance without causing horrible sounding hum that would annoy an audience and a much a i love /r/guitar i feel like all of you brilliant folk here might have more understanding of the technical end of this issue i've noticed that various player with really big guitar sound like adam jones of tool have multi amp setup even guy like zakk wylde use a chorus pedal with multiple amp to thicken their sound at the moment i have a bos dd 6 delay with stereo out and i'm looking to add a bos chorus pedal and bos reverb pedal with stereo out a well what i'd like to go for is an a/b/y setup so i have the option of running two amp simultaneously during live performance i actually would even be interested in running three amp simultaneously if possible though this isn't absolutely necessary if a three way splitter is insanely expensive compared to a two way a/b/y one i'm fine with sticking to the two way one hauling two amp to a show would probably be enough work a it is i've read how on album like siamese dream multi tracking/layering guitar part wa a huge part of getting that monstrous tone which got me thinking that if i rigged up two or three amp to use all at once while playing live or while recording i might be able to sort of approximate that effect adam jones of tool us three amp with each one focused on handling a different chunk of the frequency range or configured to create a different tonality gt so i ve always played with two or three amp one for high end one that s good with midrange and one that kick in with the low or i use one that s got that good solid state metallica crunch and one that s got that warm marshall tube sound http //www guitarworld com/gw archive/dear guitar hero adam jones tool talk tone gear video band anonymity time between album and more of course in my case what i'm going for won't be anywhere near the corgan esque wall of sound derived from stacking 20 or 30 guitar track all at once but having two amp going at once is still a 100 increase in guitar it might also make recording multiple guitar track easier and give me an interesting way to get tonal variety from recording the same guitar part i could have two amp going at once have them both miced up but have them configured differently so that while i'm playing one guitar part two different guitar tone would be generated and recorded and this variation in tone could result from different amp setting or simply by virtue of using say a solid state amp alongside a tube amp question re splitter box and hum i have done some research and it seems that a splitter that eliminates ground hum is vital http //www premierguitar com/articles/tone_stacking_with_two_amps http //www seymourduncan com/blog/the tone garage/multi amp rig 101 but i don't know anything about this kind of gadget i e what brand make them what price range they usually fall in what feature to look for who make decent one that aren't crazy expensive etc i've never tried to rig up anything this complex are there any a/b/y splitter box that are of decent/solid quality that effectively eliminate hum issue without being ultra expensive it would be cool to run three amp at once but if such a box is prohibitively expensive two amp is fine question re micing these amp during live show and recording also i wa wondering if you guy might have some input on way to mic these two amp during live show and at home in my adam jones research i found this information from one of tool's engineer saying he would use two mics on each of jones' amp gt adam mainly run three amp he ha a marshall that he love a diezel and then he wa using a mesa boogie at one point i brought in a bogner uberschall head and a rivera knucklehead reverb and several other thing then we just experimented with combination of head and cabinet until it worked for the song most of the 4 12 were mesa boogie cabinet which are superior for their low end except for the marshall head which went through a marshall cabinet and the rivera went through a rivera cabinet i usually used stock miking for me that's a shure sm57 and a sennheiser 421 on every cabinet the third mic could be anything that i felt the sound needed more of http //www guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jones tool guitar rig/ do you guy similarly recommend a combo mic setup of an sm57 and a sennheiser 421 at the moment i just have one sm57 and three sm58s but at some point i might be open to getting other mics what doe the 421 do that is different from the sm57 would it make a difference in my sound while playing live or just be too much unnecessary work for the sound guy question re capturing three discrete guitar track from three amp simultaneously in one take this question might be too focused on recording to be included here so feel free to skip it i just thought i should include it anyways since it is the last element i'd need to cover i have a very basic behringer xenyx 1204 4 channel mixer with a separate uca 200 rca to usb interface that go into my computer i'd be interested in being able to capture separate track simultaneously by individually micing different guitar amp while i play a single take and running these mic cable into separate channel on a mixer this interview about adam jone's recording technique explains what i mean gt the signal chain for tracking guitar wa a bit complex adam would play into whatever pedal he needed barresi say that signal then went into a systematic system splitter then it would go to between three and five head the signal from the head went to their own individual cabinet each cabinet had two or three microphone on it then all the microphone came back to the console and they were blended down a separated for each amp the diezel amp went to it own track the marshall amp went to it own track the third track wa a blend of the bogner and the rivera or whatever i liked for the song and that would be one take three track of guitar http //www guitarfxdepot com/rigs/adam jones tool guitar rig/ in my case the problem is that when i run two or three or four mics into my mixer then out into the separate rca/usb interface and into audacity on my computer that everything will just get mixed down into one single track is there any way to have a mixer simultaneously record to multiple discrete track on a computer program is the issue that my mixer doesn't have a usb output built in would i be able to lay down multiple discrete track all at once with a different mixer again no worry if people don't want to answer this last question the other two more directly connect to livesound whereas this is tied more to recording sorry for the long post but thanks in advance you guy were incredibly helpful on my recent post asking about custom earplug for live performing so i really value your expertise

1304,between the line 1 interpret the phase trace welcom to what i plan to be a seri of post show analyz trace from the wild as well as an explan of what inform i glean from that data and how it inform my decis in the field base on my last post http //www reddit com/r/livesound/comments/9vac2i/system_optimization_qa/ it seem like some more technic writeup might be relev to thi commun i would welcom some feedback as to whether thi is the case if for no other reason than write them up is time consum okay then onto the good stuff i'm start with a common topic of confus what the heck is thi phase respons trace tell us well it tell us a lot of thing but one aspect of it is someth like ask the question what point in it cycl wa thi frequenc at when the measur wa taken for a singl frequenc thi tell us just about noth but when observ over a frequenc rang we can glean a lot of use inform for us we need to look for trend here is a veri basic rule of thumb that cover a lot of the common phase trace question 1 the steeper the phase trace slope the more time offset exist 2 if the slope is descend left to right the arriv is late if the slope is ascend left to right the arriv is earli let me be clear the phase trace indic lot of differ thing but thi simpl concept will get you some clariti in a lot of situat let' see some exampl http //imgur com/e1cauez http //imgur com/e1cauez here is a trace taken dure the benchtest of a system processor note that i person choos to view magnitud respons on top and phase respons on the bottom thi is the opposit of the default view in smaart so just be awar of that there' a few thing to point out here 1 the phase trace is descend left to right so it' indic a late arriv as i mention abov in thi particular case i simpli hadn't yet ad delay to the analyz to compens for the device' latenc the trace get steeper with frequenc becaus the same amount of time offset will caus more phase offset at higher frequenc becaus those cycl happen faster thi is linear we have twice as much phase offset at 1k as we do at 500 hz becaus the cycl take half the time the slope appear to be increas becaus of the log frequenc axi if you were to view the phase trace on a linear frequenc axi it would be a constant slope if you have rew which you should becaus it' free give it a tri 2 look at the magnitud display we see that the coher the red line across the top drop abov 10 khz and the associ frequenc respons data is no bueno thi is becaus the time delay is so much that at these frequenc the inform come back outsid the time window and therefor is not consid to correl with the refer signal think about an echo that take a week to come back it no longer correl with what we yell to caus the echo and so it' now nois that' what the coher trace show us how confid it is in the answer it' give put anoth way is the frequenc respons thi way becaus it' relat to the refer signal or is there just nois in the room that ha noth to do with our test signal how do we tell hvac from lf pink nois the analyz will do the same calcul a bunch of time and averag the result over success measur return the same answer over and over is high coher if it' wander around or what the mic is pick up doesn't seem to be relat to the signal we'r send out coher drop we can actual figur out how much delay we'r deal with by do a littl math the first wraparound pass through 0 again at just about 1 khz so we'v gone 360 one cycl back over a 1000 hz rang 1/1000 1 ms thi trick is more or less what we'r ask the analyz to do if we view a group delay plot let' enabl that option http //imgur com/v5srypi http //imgur com/v5srypi and there you have it a solid line at about 1 ms if the phase shift is caus by someth other than a linear time offset thi will not be a flat line so be care make infer about the entir frequenc range' delay base on use onli two point for the manual mental calcul if you'r wonder what those littl wiggl are i can't say for certain but my hypothesi is that those are the point at which the fft switch to a differ time window length mayb someon can enlighten me so let' look at how we might actual use thi knowledg in the wild thi imag show measur taken of two speaker left and right in a small home audio listen room with nasti acoust but that' anoth topic http //imgur com/lmhdahb http //imgur com/lmhdahb we have a few problem here but direct your attent to the phase trace at the listen posit where thi measur wa taken one of the speaker is arriv earlier becaus it' closer which one that would be the thicker teal trace becaus it ha a steeper slope more time offset and it' ascend from left to right earli arriv we have to look at the hf here becaus the lf ha the normal descend trend associ with lf driver and we'v got some bad modal issu interf we do a whole wrap whole cycl between 2k and 3k so let' add a millisecond delay to that channel in the dsp http //imgur com/aygedu3 http //imgur com/aygedu3 much better in a larg venu situat larger than one listen thi is close enough for show busi becaus move over one seat will result in a complet differ result but thi is a listen room and we know exactli where the listen is go to be sit so let' get closer we'r about 90 degre off at 8 khz a full cycl at 8 khz is 125 ms so we don't need much delay to fix thi in fact a quarter cycl 90 would be 31 microsecond heh so let' chang our delay to 95 ms and see if we miss it the other way http //imgur com/g9bgjga http //imgur com/g9bgjga we do inde the final solut end up be 0 954m http //imgur com/i7egjbx http //imgur com/i7egjbx i could have actual lock in all the way up to 16 khz given a dsp with suffici delay resolut but the distanc between the listener' ear is multipl wavelength at these frequenc so drill down ani further is arguabl pointless sinc both ear can't even perceiv the benefit plu i wa readi for my lunch break at that point hope thi wa help and not just a wast of my time i can't say how often i'll be abl to do writeup becaus i you know work and i realli like video game but happi to answer ani relev question about audio not video game edit sorri left out first imag fix,between the line 1 interpreting the phase trace welcome to what i plan to be a series of post showing analyzer trace from the wild a well a an explanation of what information i gleaned from that data and how it informed my decision in the field based on my last post http //www reddit com/r/livesound/comments/9vac2i/system_optimization_qa/ it seems like some more technical writeups might be relevant to this community i would welcome some feedback a to whether this is the case if for no other reason than writing them up is time consuming okay then onto the good stuff i'm starting with a common topic of confusion what the heck is this phase response trace telling u well it tell u a lot of thing but one aspect of it is something like asking the question what point in it cycle wa this frequency at when the measurement wa taken for a single frequency this tell u just about nothing but when observed over a frequency range we can glean a lot of useful information for u we need to look for trend here is a very basic rule of thumb that cover a lot of the common phase trace question 1 the steeper the phase trace slope the more time offset exists 2 if the slope is descending left to right the arrival is late if the slope is ascending left to right the arrival is early let me be clear the phase trace indicates lot of different thing but this simple concept will get you some clarity in a lot of situation let's see some example http //imgur com/e1cauez http //imgur com/e1cauez here is a trace taken during the benchtesting of a system processor note that i personally choose to view magnitude response on top and phase response on the bottom this is the opposite of the default view in smaart so just be aware of that there's a few thing to point out here 1 the phase trace is descending left to right so it's indicating a late arrival a i mentioned above in this particular case i simply hadn't yet added delay to the analyzer to compensate for the device's latency the trace get steeper with frequency because the same amount of time offset will cause more phase offset at higher frequency because those cycle happen faster this is linear we have twice a much phase offset at 1k a we do at 500 hz because the cycle take half the time the slope appears to be increasing because of the log frequency axis if you were to view the phase trace on a linear frequency axis it would be a constant slope if you have rew which you should because it's free give it a try 2 looking at the magnitude display we see that the coherence the red line across the top drop above 10 khz and the associated frequency response data is no bueno this is because the time delay is so much that at these frequency the information come back outside the time window and therefore is not considered to correlate with the reference signal think about an echo that take a week to come back it no longer correlate with what we yelled to cause the echo and so it's now noise that's what the coherence trace show u how confident it is in the answer it's giving put another way is the frequency response this way because it's related to the reference signal or is there just noise in the room that ha nothing to do with our test signal how do we tell hvac from lf pink noise the analyzer will do the same calculation a bunch of time and average the result over successive measurement returning the same answer over and over is high coherence if it's wandering around or what the mic is picking up doesn't seem to be related to the signal we're sending out coherence drop we can actually figure out how much delay we're dealing with by doing a little math the first wraparound pass through 0 again at just about 1 khz so we've gone 360 one cycle back over a 1000 hz range 1/1000 1 m this trick is more or le what we're asking the analyzer to do if we view a group delay plot let's enable that option http //imgur com/v5srypi http //imgur com/v5srypi and there you have it a solid line at about 1 m if the phase shift is caused by something other than a linear time offset this will not be a flat line so be careful making inference about the entire frequency range's delay based on using only two point for the manual mental calculation if you're wondering what those little wiggle are i can't say for certain but my hypothesis is that those are the point at which the fft switch to a different time window length maybe someone can enlighten me so let's look at how we might actually use this knowledge in the wild this image show measurement taken of two speaker left and right in a small home audio listening room with nasty acoustic but that's another topic http //imgur com/lmhdahb http //imgur com/lmhdahb we have a few problem here but direct your attention to the phase trace at the listening position where this measurement wa taken one of the speaker is arriving earlier because it's closer which one that would be the thicker teal trace because it ha a steeper slope more time offset and it's ascending from left to right early arrival we have to look at the hf here because the lf ha the normal descending trend associated with lf driver and we've got some bad modal issue interfering we do a whole wrap whole cycle between 2k and 3k so let's add a millisecond delay to that channel in the dsp http //imgur com/aygedu3 http //imgur com/aygedu3 much better in a large venue situation larger than one listener this is close enough for show business because moving over one seat will result in a completely different result but this is a listening room and we know exactly where the listener is going to be sitting so let's get closer we're about 90 degree off at 8 khz a full cycle at 8 khz is 125 m so we don't need much delay to fix this in fact a quarter cycle 90 would be 31 microsecond heh so let's change our delay to 95 m and see if we miss it the other way http //imgur com/g9bgjga http //imgur com/g9bgjga we do indeed the final solution ended up being 0 954ms http //imgur com/i7egjbx http //imgur com/i7egjbx i could have actually locked in all the way up to 16 khz given a dsp with sufficient delay resolution but the distance between the listener's ear is multiple wavelength at these frequency so drilling down any further is arguably pointless since both ear can't even perceive the benefit plus i wa ready for my lunch break at that point hopefully this wa helpful and not just a waste of my time i can't say how often i'll be able to do writeups because i you know work and i really like video game but happy to answer any relevant question about audio not video game edit sorry left out first image fixed

as well as the local acoust environ how much lf buildup the room will contribut ultim thi question will be answer by listen to refer record and tweak the tilt until it sound correct then that becom the target curv to which i'll match the rest of the system rest of the system in thi case mean the other side the initi respons actual had a slight upward tilt to it look at 3 khz and up http //imgur com/a9e7pax http //imgur com/a9e7pax thi is partli becaus the room is small enough that a lot of the hf bounc off the wall and ceil show up in the measur notic poor coher and also partli becaus we'r onli about 15 feet away from a rel larg loudspeak that' design to throw a lot farther than across a live room so there' not nearli as much hf air attenu as we would see further back in it intend applic thi make sens but it sound quit bad as confirm by listen to my refer music so let' fix that http //imgur com/3aoras9 http //imgur com/3aoras9 pink pre eq raw respons blue post eq now hold your hors i'm sure you are wonder about that 63 hz peak and i'll get there i use a hi shelf filter at 3 khz to get rid of that upward tilt and a cut at around 400 hz to rein in that midrang bump that might be a lobe from the crossov it' a 15 system and the listen posit is vertic below onax but 400 still seem low to me or it might be a modal thing the deep narrow cancel on either side lend credenc to both hypothes and sinc they'r cancel you can't eq them back up to normal to a first approxim that is true if it is modal good acoust treatment can do a world of good but that' not within the scope of the job okay so for the 63 hz issu thi look surprisingli similar to the sub bump that you see on a modern larg format pa system out of the box see thi imag http //imgur com/iubw6nt if it look familiar it' becaus it' from the same setup as pictur in the jim yak articl i link abov jim snap it on hi phone it show hi k2 rig out of the box with sub mute and there' still a heck of an lf bump hi magnitud trace is bottom pane which is the smaart default sinc thi system is primarili go to be use for the owner to play loud rock music i left it we'r run without sub here so thi is actual an impress show it didn't sound reson or honki dure playback if it end up be too much we can alway go back and roll it back but i suspect it will work out well for the owner of the system thi is a judgement call though so there' no right or wrong just what' best for the situat usual we also feed the output of the dsp into the analyz so we can see the eq curv on the screen as well while thi is extrem help it' not strictli necessari and in thi case it' not possibl sinc the dsp is onboard the activ loudspeak so here we just see the befor and after respons i'll includ a screenshot of the final filter set from the dsp at the end so you can see the filter i use the appli eq look like a rel minor chang on the screen but boy did it sound a whole lot better i'm use 1/12 oct averag which is lower resolut than i usual prefer but becaus of the low coher and nasti room problem more averag clarifi the gener trend for me in thi case we'r deal in broad stroke here not tri to go in and equal everi singl littl bump for a varieti of reason the small scale detail tend not to be veri audibl wherea the ear is incred respons to the wideband stuff for exampl after listen the hf still sound too bright and one more db on the shelf work wonder so by focus on the broad stroke we can make some realli big improv with rel few gentl filter note the phase respons befor and after is almost ident the filter here are so low q that there' virtual no chang thi would not be the case for realli narrow high q filter which are all too often adopt by the autoeq plugin etc the phase shift itself is of cours not audibl but the reson certainli can be now let' go back and see the post eq left compar to the right channel http //imgur com/i7egjbx http //imgur com/i7egjbx the match phase trace indic match arriv time at the listen posit see part 1 and so look next at the magnitud trace on top we can see further issu the right loudspeak brown trace is significantli louder than the left side if it' within a db it' noth to write home about but these graph have a vertic scale of 3 db / divis so what we'r see here is signific it' also audibl it' import to alway check these thing as we go a simpl listen test can prevent you from make bad decis base on improp or incomplet data it' import to rememb that the analyz simpli give us more data and it' up to us to interpret that data and make an inform decis so we need a gain chang how much it' easi to offset trace in the softwar until they line up in thi case it end up be 4 db that' larger than a manufactur toler so befor crank the gain in dsp it help to actual determin what the issu is in thi case one of the input gain block in the loudspeaker' onboard dsp wa set incorrectli and after remov the attenu l and r line up just fine http //imgur com/oyege6o http

for speech or music a well a the local acoustic environment how much lf buildup the room will contribute ultimately this question will be answered by listening to reference recording and tweaking the tilt until it sound correct then that becomes the target curve to which i'll match the rest of the system rest of the system in this case mean the other side the initial response actually had a slight upward tilt to it look at 3 khz and up http //imgur com/a9e7pax http //imgur com/a9e7pax this is partly because the room is small enough that a lot of the hf bouncing off the wall and ceiling show up in the measurement notice poor coherence and also partly because we're only about 15 foot away from a relatively large loudspeaker that's designed to throw a lot farther than across a living room so there's not nearly a much hf air attenuation a we would see further back in it intended application this make sense but it sounded quite bad a confirmed by listening to my reference music so let's fix

this look surprisingly similar to the sub bump that you see on a modern large format pa system out of the box see this image http //imgur com/iubw6nt if it look familiar it's because it's from the same setup a pictured in the jim yak article i linked above jim snapped it on his phone it show his k2 rig out of the box with sub muted and there's still a heck of an lf bump his magnitude trace is

better i'm using 1/12 oct averaging which is lower resolution than i usually prefer but because of the low coherence and nasty room problem more averaging clarified the general trend for me in this case we're dealing in broad stroke here not trying to go in and equalize every single little bump for a variety of reason the small scale detail tend not to be very audible whereas the ear is incredibly responsive to the wideband stuff for example after listening the hf still sounded too bright and one more db on the shelf worked wonder so by focusing on the broad stroke we can make some really big improvement with relatively few gentle filter note the phase response before and after is almost identical the filter here are so low q that there's virtually no change this would not be the case for really narrow high q filter which are all too often adopted by the autoeq plugins etc the phase shift itself is of course not audible but the resonance certainly can be now let's go back and see the post eq left compared to the right channel http //imgur com/i7egjbx http //imgur com/i7egjbx the matched phase trace indicate matched arrival time at the listening position see part 1 and so looking next at the magnitude trace on top we can see further issue the right loudspeaker brown trace is significantly louder than the left side if it's within a db it's nothing to write home about but these graph have a vertical scaling of 3 db / division so what we're seeing here is significant it's also audible it's important to always check these thing a we go a simple listening test can prevent you from making bad decision based on improper or incomplete data it's important to remember that the analyzer simply give u more data and it's up to u to interpret that data and make an informed decision so we need a gain change how much it's easy to offset trace in the software until they line up in this case it ended up being 4 db that's larger than a manufacturing tolerance so before cranking the gain in dsp it help to actually determine what the issue is in this case one of the input gain block in the loudspeaker's onboard dsp wa set incorrectly and after removing the attenuation l and r lined up just fine http //imgur com/oyege6o http //imgur com/oyege6o right's just a smidge higher but that's okay because we're looking at it unequalized response v left's equalized response since most of the eq work will be subtractive this is nothing to be concerned about right side eq choice were similarly sparing http //imgur com/qzdcjwt http //imgur com/qzdcjwt red trace is post eq and here's l and r together http //imgur com/t62cyvt http //imgur com/t62cyvt considering the bad room l and r are pretty well matched in a tonal sense the eq necessary for this wa asymmetrical because the room itself a well a the loudspeakers' placement within is also asymmetrical http //imgur com/yuvcze4 http //imgur com/yuvcze4 focus on the white line because even bypassed filter contribute to the blue shading for some reason note that the macro trend are the same gentle cut in the lo mid and the hf i ended up with two cascaded hf shelf cut to get it to sound right up

944,speaker recommend for a jazz venu hey all look for some recommend for a pa system for the venu i manag we'r a 1200sq ft extrem oddli shape room http //imgur com/a/njsbfml our venu exclus present jazz mostli modern stuff sinc the room is small enough the acoust level of the drum realli dictat what we throw in the pa which is usual piano and voic and occasion horn that aren't way too loud our room is sort of treat so there isn't stuff bounc around all over the place but definit still a live kind of boomi room our current system is a pair of macki sa1530z the issu i encount is how the sound of the room chang base on where you'r sit in the middl area of the room up to where the mixer is there' a rais roof that goe up about 24 feet the room is at it' regular height at the stage and behind the mixer which is 14 feet as you might guess the chang in roof size affect the sound and thing sound differ on stage vs right in front of the stage vs all the way behind the mixer addit the room also get tinier as in like an l shape so you realli don't get much of the stage right speaker in the back of the room my first thought is that the macki are rais at the 14 feet height of the ceil so hang at about 11 12 feet and are point straight which affect the peopl at the front of the room sit sort of underneath the speaker they don't get as much of it as someon sit in the back as i mention the room is treat but the shape of the room is realli hard to fight so there' onli so much the treatment can do for us so for now i'd like to solv the speaker issu and see if there' ani better option avail for a 1200sq ft room two 1300watt speaker are a bit much i think although i can't seem to find anyth smaller than that that is also 3 way so my first question/assumpt is chang the way my current macki are mount by aim them a bit more down would that help the distribut of sound my second question is are there ani speaker that may be better suit for the job for a second i wa think about do a faux vertic array with 4 speaker 2 on each side one pair point straight ahead and one pair point down more but mayb there' a singl pair of speaker that may do the trick without have to work on an array i should mention my budget for thi is 2000 hope less obvious chang the mount on my current speaker would be the cheapest option probabl not run me ani more than 1000 for the part and labor but speaker i'v been look at have been 1000 each hope to hear some good suggest and thank in advanc,speaker recommendation for a jazz venue hey all looking for some recommendation for a pa system for the

drum really dictate what we throw in the pa which is usually piano and voice and occasionally horn that aren't way too loud our room is sort of treated so there isn't stuff bouncing around all over the place but definitely still a live kind of boomy room our current system is a pair of mackie sa1530z the issue i encounter is how the sound of the room change based on where you're sitting in the middle area of the room up to where the mixer is there's a raised roof that go up about 24 foot the room is at it's regular height at the stage and behind the mixer which is 14 foot a you might guess the change in roof size affect the sound and thing sound different on stage v right in front of the stage v all the way behind the mixer additionally the room also get tinier a in like an l shape so you really don't get much of the stage right speaker in the back of the room my first thought is that the mackies are raised at the 14 foot height of the ceiling so hanging at about 11 12 foot and are pointed straight which affect the people at the front of the room sitting sort of underneath the speaker they don't get a much of it a someone sitting in the back a i mentioned the room is treated but the shape of the room is really hard to fight so there's only so much the treatment can do for u so for now i'd like to solve the speaker issue and see if there's any better option available for a 1200sq ft room two 1300watt speaker are a bit much i think although i can't seem to find anything smaller than that that is also 3 way so my first question/assumption is changing the way my current

1288,whi is there no daw consol it' possibl that thi exist and i'm not awar of it so pleas forgiv me in that case to clarifi what i mean by daw consol when you set up a studio or live record you'll gener have a daw and a consol that interfac with it that creat a redund situat becaus daw will typic have a virtual mixer that ha basic all the same function of your physic mix consol even with a simpl audio interfac without full channel process you'll usual still have rout option that oper independ from the intern rout in your daw and preamp that need to be control separ what i think would be interest is a consol that' essenti a glorifi audio interfac daw control with digit control preamp that are control from within the softwar all surfac control actual control your daw' virtual mixer and all rout mirror your daw rout the softwar could be a special version of protools/cubase/etc that' meant to be control with thi mixer the mix engin would be a power comput that' dedic to run the daw at low latenc you can then run all your favourit vst and plugin dure live perform and you can record multitrack and play thing back easili i hope thi make sens let me know what you think doe that exist,why is there no daw console it's possible that this exists and i'm not aware of it so please forgive me in that case to clarify what i mean by daw console when you set up a studio or live recording you'll generally have a daw and a console that interface with it that creates a redundant situation because daw will typically have a virtual mixer that ha basically all the same functionality of your physical mixing console even with a simple audio interface without full channel processing you'll usually still have routing option that operate independently from the internal routing in your daw and preamps that need to be controlled separately what i think would be interesting is a console that's essentially a glorified audio interface daw controller with digitally controlled preamps that are controlled from within the software all surface control actually control your daw's virtual mixer and all routing mirror your daw routing the software could be a specialized version of protools/cubase/etc that's meant to be controlled with this mixer the mix engine would be a powerful computer that's dedicated to running the daw at low latency you can then run all your favourite vsts and plugins during live performance and you can record multitrack and play thing back easily i hope this make sense let me know what you think doe that exist

of the hous i can view a real time stereo spectrogram use adob audit 1 5 record at onli 441 hz i pick thi frequenc becaus it' 1/100th the normal sampl rate that i use and i can see a beauti high

40x slower than the origin be sure to re sampl and not time stretch ugh 2 load the 40x slower version into hog convolv it use the follow paramet input load your slow down wav sampl here impuls load your slow down wav sampl here ye the same file we will self convolv output name your new file whatev make sens for you turn on move brighten and 32 bit normal no scale impuls no mix back input window blackman _harri impuls length 0 25 length is measur in second process it 3 open your output wav and re sampl it back to the origin durat and viola it is a new method of nois reduct note1 best for use on veri quiet sound among background air sound note2 horribl for use on clarifi garbl speech or differenti speech among other peopl btw if anyon know method for how to do that let me know best i'v tri so far is manual select use adob audit cc2015 and spectralay req1 if anyon tri thi method and discov better set along the way or interest idea pleas share that' what thi post is for req2 if anyon know ani other rare or interest audio restor or just ani interest effect similar to these pleas share that as well i'm on the lookout for more method i know about cedar studio 7 i just cant afford it i wish there wa a trial version i could use but i can't find one so that' anoth thing i'm look for i'm determin to improv thi setup and i'm happi to help anyon with idea or wish to make a similar setup,low frequency spectrogram technique noise reduction technique i hear a low frequency hum where i live in west baltimore city it's louder at night only in winter and come and go over long period like several hour i have some theory but this isn't about that anyway in order to analyse i have two 15 bass amplifier plugged in a microphone which work beautifully one in the basement on the floor and one on the first floor of the house i can view a real time stereo spectrogram using adobe audition 1 5 recording at only 441 hz i picked this frequency because it's 1/100th the normal sample rate that i use and i can see a beautiful high resolution spectrogram at 2048 band appear live of only low frequency audio showing everything up to 220 hz it only look good after about 5 minute a it need to show some duration for the sake of sharpness i'm looking to further analyse this and improve the quality of the analysis i also have some distant noise coming in in higher frequency recorded at higher sampling rate that i wish to isolate using whatever noise reduction tool i can find so far i have tried various combination of application and plugins including built in noise reduction using adobe audition 1 5 built in noise reduction using adobe audition 3 built in noise reduction using adobe audition cc2015 izotope rx 5 izotope ozone 8 spectralayers pro 5 one of the best spear isse praat ar wave wns wave x noise wave z noise acon restoration acon's de hum is the best live de hum effect i have found up to 96 harmonic with live attenuation odd only option diamond cut forensics 10 dcf's de hum is the best post processing de hum effect up to 400 harmonic odd only option sound it 8 pro which come with the sonnox restoration bundle and even celemony melodyne 4 for selecting unwanted partial to remove which work surprisingly well but today i had an idea and i needed to post this and share because the best idea seem to come from thinking outside of the box what i did wa this i used an old audio effect program called hog v0 71b to load a wav recording and convolve it the trick is 1 take the wav sample with the quiet bg sound you wish to isolate and slow it way way down to like 40x slower than the original be sure to re sample and not time stretch ugh 2 load the 40x slower version into hog convolve it using the following parameter input load your slowed down wav sample here impulse load your slowed down wav sample here yes the same file we will self convolve output name your new file whatever make sense for you turn on moving brighten and 32 bit normalize no scale impulse no mix back input window blackman _harris impulse length 0 25 length is measured in second process it 3 open your output wav and re sample it back to the original duration and viola it is a new method of noise reduction note1 best for use on very quiet sound among background air sound note2 horrible for use on clarifying garbled speech or differentiating speech among other people btw if anyone know method for how to do that let me know best i've tried so far is manually selecting using adobe audition cc2015 and spectralayers req1 if anyone try this method and discovers better setting along the way or interesting idea please share that's what this post is for req2 if anyone know any other rare or interesting audio restoration or just any interesting effect similar to these please share that a well i'm on the lookout for more method i know about cedar studio 7 i just cant afford it i wish there wa a trial version i could use but i can't find one so that's another thing i'm looking for i'm determined to improve this setup and i'm happy to help anyone with idea or wishing to make a similar setup

yesterday befor my gig today i nearli cri the musician are world class and thi wa a celebr of a hospit be around for 90 year sooooooo the fun part it wa a church like set up with the ugliest ramsa 12x2 box hang way up in the ceil point downish i refer it it work ok good how about the miniatur delay further back under a balconi nope trace everi cabl start to finish sent a signal from the one speaker that work known good sourc still noth they look like rear speaker in a goofi surround sound system for someone' apart there' a 1400 watt amp power them like grenad them 20 year ago haha so anyway i test the first gen mix wiz and unsurprisingli it work flawlessli damn those littl bugger were/ar great everi last piec of it yay alright let' eq thi room a bit yep bad but workabl did you know ramsa made a 32 band eq me either it work good enough haha ok let' check out your monitor how mani can i do 4 great oh it' all 1 mix oh it use to be passiv but we blew them all up so now we have 3 differ power wedg we plug the 1/4 inch speaker cabl into and then just turn them way down becaus it seem too loud then we daisi chain all the wedg off of that holi shit i explain to the hous tech how fuck up that is he explain some of the power wedg act funni i explain whi hahaha instead of run a regular signal to them they'v been use a speaker cabl outta a power amp into the power wedge' input becaus that' how the pa wa instal ok forget that nonsens i'm gonna eat up some channel on the snake and use a few barrel and turnaround to get proper signal into your power wedg and have more than 1 mix anyway long stori short i did the gig today under arguabl some of the worst condit i could'v dream about and it went off without ani problem and actual sound great i couldn't believ it one damn speaker it made me feel fuckin great becaus i'm so use have nice equip to work with that thi one made me work for someth reason it wa a shit load of fun the musician were happi the hous tech

monitor how many can i do 4 great oh it's all 1 mix oh it used to be passive but we blew them all up so now we have 3 different powered wedge we plug the 1/4 inch speaker cable into and then just turn them way down because it seems too loud then we daisy chain all the wedge off of that holy shit i explain to the house tech how fucked up that is he explains some of the powered wedge act funny i explain why hahaha instead of running a regular signal to them they've been using a speaker cable outta a power amp into the powered wedge's input because that's how the pa wa installed ok forget that nonsense i'm gonna eat up some channel on the snake and use a few barrel and turnaround to get proper signal into your powered wedge and have more than 1 mix anyway long story short i did the gig today under arguably some of the worst condition i could've dreamed about and it went off without any problem and actually sounded great i couldn't believe it one damn speaker it made me feel fuckin

system seem nice enough better than the old system for sure but the cheaper materi and the non remov yet flexibl antenna make me nervou about their longev they also seem quit hot sound wise last year though i'm still think there' someth on our end we'r miss on that front plan to do some experiment regard that gain issu thi thanksgiv befor audit time to see if it improv all in all they work well enough but we want them to last as long as we can i think i can get away with push a higher end offer if they'll work better or last longer but there' no way we can jump up to a qlx/ulx or someth that costli i wa then look to see if shure offer a mid market option and they do but it wa a 2 4ghz system and i quickli dismiss thi howev their new advanc system is caus me to give it anoth look they claim to handl up to 11 channel and if we keep blx for part of our setup the thought is we could have 6 or so run on glx reliabl thi would allow us to have more rf spectrum to work with to coordin our other mic as we tour around those system appear to be better made the batteri system also look to be a huge conveni never have to worri about batteri die in show or convinc someon to go run to walmart for more again with time remain indic and a recharg spare right in the receiv and they'll never be affect by futur fcc spectrum chang but that said at the end of the day they have to work and while we'r mostli perform away from dens wi fi area i don't want there to be a major problem with the mani wireless devic our team actor and audienc use tech crew often sit in audienc area our tech setup is somewher around 40 50' from the stage our snake is 50' long so it shouldn't ever be much further back than that again we sit in the audienc and have the antenna clear the audienc ha been an issu befor with uhf and i wonder if 2 4 will make that wors ha anyon tri thi use the glx d adv frequenc manag with the stock antenna i would expect it to work with the paddl becaus they'r direct but becaus of our quick setup tour and budget focus natur ad the time and cost expens of set up paddl antenna right up by the stage probabl wouldn't be worth it i'm also interest if there are other option anyon may recommend in that sort of price rang right now i'm still lean toward just push to get more blx system becaus it' still cheaper and doesn't have 2 4g problem but if there' a better but still cost practic way i'd love to hear it thank for ani info tl dr we are replac our mic system blx in earli test had some problem and concern but not terribl is glx d adv worth the upgrad or will it caus even more problem and is there a better option to consid thank,shure blx v glx d advanced or other budget option i'm looking for a new wireless microphone system to recommend for a low budget operation we typically use 11 mics per show and 2 handhelds 8 of which are aging and also affected by the 600mhz spectrum reallocation a for the other 3 1 of them is a 2000 series audio technica that happened to be i band so isn't affected the rest were d band and the remaining 2 are new shure blx system we bought last year a t hadn't updated their line in a long while and when they finally did they made a new connector that seemingly isn't compatible with any mics they don't make themselves the blx system seem nice enough better than the old system for sure but the cheaper material and the non removable yet flexible antenna make me nervous about their longevity they also seemed quite hot sound wise last year though i'm still thinking there's something on our end we're missing on that front planning to do some experimentation regarding that gain issue this thanksgiving before audition time to see if it improves all in all they work well enough but we want them to last a long a we can i think i can get away with pushing a higher end offering if they'll work better or last longer but there's no way we can jump up to a qlx/ulx or something that costly i wa then looking to see if shure offered a mid market option and they do but it wa a 2 4ghz system and i quickly dismissed this however their new advanced system is causing me to give it another look they claim to handle up to 11 channel and if we keep blx for part of our setup the thought is we could have 6 or so running on glx reliably this would allow u to have more rf spectrum to work with to coordinate our other mics a we tour around those system appear to be better made the battery system also look to be a huge convenience never having to worry about battery dying in show or convincing someone to go running to walmart for more again with time remaining indicator and a rechargeable spare right in the receiver and they'll never be affected by future fcc spectrum change but that said at the end of the day they have to work and while we're mostly performing away from dense wi fi area i don't want there to be a major problem with the many wireless device our team actor and audience us tech crew often sits in audience area our tech setup is somewhere around 40 50' from the stage our snake is 50' long so it shouldn't ever be much further back than that again we sit in the audience and having the antenna clear the audience ha been an issue before with uhf and i wonder if 2 4 will make that worse ha anyone tried this using the glx d adv frequency manager with the stock antenna i would expect it to work with the paddle because they're directional but because of our quick setup touring and budget focused nature adding the time and cost expense of setting up paddle antenna right up by the stage probably wouldn't be worth it i'm also interested if there are other option anyone may recommend in that sort of price range right now i'm still leaning toward just pushing to get more blx system because it's still cheaper and doesn't have 2 4g problem but if there's a better but still cost practical way i'd love to hear it thanks for any info tl dr we are replacing our mic system blx in early testing had some problem and concern but not terrible is glx d adv worth the upgrade or will it cause even more problem and is there a better option to consider thanks

1850,concern about potenti for hear loss as audienc member and perform at concert until i'm abl to afford a wireless iem system is it possibl to buy custom ear plug that block out or quiet the most harm frequencies/sound level while still allow for adequ listening/monitor warn long post i'm hope to start a proper band project and start play bar gig but i'm veri concern about the potenti for hear loss i attend bar show on a weekli basi sometim twice a week but the one thing well apart from the tendenc to get pull into excess late night and too much drink that realli drive me nut is the loud of basic everi singl concert i attend there' absolut noth i can do about thi sinc everi guitarist want to blast their amp to 11 which i absolut understand as a guitarist myself ego is a hell of a drug but also becaus most of these bar space are pretti small and even without the live sound run through the speaker the sound in that enclos space is deafen what i'm wonder is if there are custom ear plug that can be purchas that might allow me to block out the more oppress sound level and frequenc to preserv my hear yet still allow me to hear enough of what i need to hear for enjoy of concert and monitor myself and my bandmat as a perform play on stage at these venu later thi year i have notic one of the long term musician in the scene wear what appear to be custom made ear plug that he ha around hi neck on a string that he wear at concert i can onli presum that they are built in such a way that he can still almost fulli enjoy the music at show and hear what he need to hear while protect hi hear doe anyon here have ani advic they could give me on such type of ear plug i imagin i might need to see an audiologist for these if they exist and they will cost in the 100 but i'm definit will to spend say 150 300 on someth like thi if can potenti preserv my hear and let me keep play and listen to music for the rest of my life question about custom ear plug and/or iem while perform my understand at the moment is that some sort of wireless iem system would be the way to go for protect my ear yet still be abl to hear what i need to hear while perform i do have a pair of shure se210 and se110 though it look like it would still cost anoth 1000 cad to get the whole wireless monitor system which i can't realli afford at the moment therefor i'm wonder if the sort of custom ear plug mention abov might allow me to protect my hear while play live yet still let enough sound through to adequ monitor thing though i get that thi might not be possibl sinc iem would actual allow sound to come through the earbud to let me hear thing wherea ear plug would just block out sound nevertheless it would be interest to see if there is some sort of middl ground between do noth and spend 1000 for a wireless iem system on that note sinc i alreadi do have a coupl set of shure iem is it at all possibl to build some kind of semi portabl wire monitor system that i could use on stage mayb involv use a littl cheap super basic behring type 1 or 2 channel mixer that i could have on stage with me and connect to the iem i know the main issu would be with tri to connect my mixer to the 'monitor sends' from the main mix board at the venu and of cours that might not be practic to run some 150 foot cabl from the sound guy' board all the way to the stage for me to use for monitor howev a at some local dedic music venu they do alreadi seem to have some kind of long cabl run a 'snake' link the stage to the soundboard where there are some 1/4 input jack avail for the guitarist to plug their guitar into that connect to the board b with these guitar input jack there are also long speaker wire run connect to some monitor speaker on the stage that perform use to hear themselv with thi kind of setup would it be theoret possibl to have the 1/4 inch speaker wire or mayb a super long 1/4 audio cabl run from the sound guy' booth that i could connect into a littl cheap mini mixer i have on stage next to me that i can plug my shure iem into so i can listen to both myself and the 'hous mix' of all the other instrument in my band while dial in my own monitor mix right there on stage also with thi kind of hypothet setup could i incorpor some kind of limit or compressor or nois reduc system that could protect my ear from ani sudden spike in volum come from the sound guy' board would a guitar nois reduc or compressor pedal work for that or would i need someth more special as bad as loud volum alreadi are at concert i can't imagin anyth wors for hear that a sudden surg in volum or feedback that run directli through my iem into my eardrum that' a terrifi prospect to consid there are musician friend i know who are incred talent yet quit a bit younger than me who have alreadi suffer consider hear loss meanwhil i know there are even some veteran sound guy who have suffer hear loss significantli which can't help with their job either i wa at 3 bar show in the last week alon and while i took break dure the first two for the last one i tough it out becaus i wa realli into the perform which is what i'v typic done up til now but i regret it alreadi as soon as i walk outsid midway through the last show my ear felt like they were complet clog and underwat and i had mild tinnitu for a good half hour after the pain i feel in my ear from the crank guitar and amp is almost immedi and i tri to sit further back from the stage though thi doesn't do much in small bar i also tri to take regular break becaus i can't stand the verit onslaught of sound i'll sometim feel a bit queasi over how loud thing are though then i feel bad for leav the show mid set becaus i don't want the band to think i'm not enjoy the perform i apolog for the length of the post and if i got ani of the technic terminolog wrong i'm not a train sound guy the most i did wa some veri basic work of a power mix while i wa run an open mic/jam night for a coupl of year though i did learn a lot in that time thank for ani input you guy and gal might offer,concerned about potential for hearing loss a audience member and performer at concert until i'm able to afford a wireless iem system is it possible to buy custom ear plug that block out or quiet the most harmful frequencies/sound level while still allowing for adequate listening/monitoring warning long post i'm hoping to start a proper band project and start playing bar gig but i'm very concerned about the potential for hearing loss i attend bar show on a weekly basis sometimes twice a week but the one thing well apart from the tendency to get pulled into excessively late night and too much drinking that really drive me nut is the loudness of basically every single concert i attend there's absolutely nothing i can do about this since every guitarist want to blast their amp to 11 which i absolutely understand a a guitarist myself ego is a hell of a drug but also because most of these bar space are pretty small and even without the live sound running through the speaker the sound in that enclosed space is deafening what i'm wondering is if there are custom ear plug that can be purchased that might allow me to block out the more oppressive sound level and frequency to preserve my hearing yet still allow me to hear enough of what i need to hear for enjoyment of concert and monitoring myself and my bandmates a a performer playing on stage at these venue later this year i have noticed one of the long term musician in the scene wearing what appear to be custom made ear plug that he ha around his neck on a string that he wear at concert i can only presume that they are built in such a way that he can still almost fully enjoy the music at show and hear what he need to hear while protecting his hearing doe anyone here have any advice they could give me on such type of ear plug i imagine i might need to see an audiologist for these if they exist and they will cost in the 100 but i'm definitely willing to spend say 150 300 on something like this if can potentially preserve my hearing and let me keep playing and listening to music for the rest of my life question about custom ear

while performing i do have a pair of shure se210s and se110s though it look like it would still cost another 1000 cad to get the whole wireless monitoring system which i can't really afford at the moment therefore i'm wondering if the sort of custom ear plug mentioned above might allow me to protect my hearing while playing live yet still let enough sound through to adequately monitor thing though i get that this might not be possible since iems would actually allow sound to come through the earbuds to let me hear thing whereas ear plug would just block out sound nevertheless it would be interesting to see if there is some sort of middle ground between doing nothing and spending 1000 for a wireless iem system on that note since i already do have a couple set of shure iems is it at all possible to build some kind of semi portable wired monitoring system that i could use on stage maybe involving using a little cheap super basic behringer type 1 or 2 channel mixer that i could have on stage with me and connect to the iems i know the main issue would be with trying to connect my mixer to the 'monitor sends' from the main mixing board at the venue and of course that might not be practical to run some 150 foot cable from the sound guy's board all the way to the stage for me to use for monitoring however a at some local dedicated music venue they do already seem to have some kind of long cable run a 'snake' linking the stage to the soundboard where there are some 1/4 input jack available for the guitarist to plug their guitar into that connect to the board b with these guitar input jack there are also long speaker wire run connecting to some monitor speaker on the stage that performer use to hear themselves with this kind of setup would it be theoretically possible to have the 1/4 inch speaker wire or maybe a super long 1/4 audio cable run from the sound guy's booth that i could connect into a little cheap mini mixer i have on stage next to me that i can plug my shure iems into so i can listen to both myself and the 'house mix' of all the other instrument in my band while dialing in my own monitor mix right there on stage also with this kind of hypothetical setup could i incorporate some kind of limiter or compressor or noise reducing system that could protect my ear from any sudden spike in volume coming from the sound guy's board would a guitar noise reducer or compressor pedal work for that or would i need something more specialized a bad a loud volume already are at concert i can't imagine anything worse for hearing that a sudden surge in volume or feedback that run directly through my iems into my eardrum that's a terrifying prospect to consider there are musician friend i know who are incredibly talented yet quite a bit younger than me who have already suffered considerable hearing loss meanwhile i know there are even some veteran sound guy who have suffered hearing loss significantly which can't help with their job either i wa at 3 bar show in the last week alone and while i took break during the first two for the last one i toughed it out because i wa really into the performer which is what i've typically done up til now but i regret it already a soon a i walked outside midway through the last show my ear felt like they were completely clogged and underwater and i had mild tinnitus for a good half hour after the pain i feel in my ear from the cranked guitar and amp is almost immediate and i try to sit further back from the stage though this doesn't do much in small bar i also try to take regular break because i can't

1894,advic on buy a new set of microphon my experi so i work both in livesound and in a studio and i'm current invest in my first set of microphon i borrow a few small diaphragm condens and personali a/b test them but all of my other assumpt are made base on a big bunch of youtub a/b comparison between mic so befor i buy i would like to hear if you would agre with what i heard pleas read my descript of the mic i'm interest in and just comment do you hear what i hear or you heard someth differ from these mic 1 condens overhead mic primarili so from a friend i got an offer to buy a stereo pair of se electron s1a microphon for an amaz price less then 100 dollar a pair i also borrow a sennheis e614 an akg c430 and an audio technica ath450 the ath is 200 euro each e614 anc c430 and 100 euro each and the s1a are obvious by far the cheapest my person test show that the e614 ha the flattest respons and the most natur sound it ha a slight midrang bump but i would pick it over the other for captur the entir kit or an instrument like an acoust guitar/violin the c430 wasn't veri natur there is a weird midrang bump didn't like it the ath wa a bit more open sound then the e614 less midrang more air but it cost twice as much and i don't think it' worth the differ the s1a have a slight boost abov 8k and are flat below 8k which to me seem like they are amaz as overhead mic sinc i get a great cymbal sound from them and i can add the midrang and definit from the closem consid the price of the use s1a' my plan wa to buy them instead of the other option i would later add anoth pair of more midrangi condend to the mic bag 2 kickdrum mic long stori short i don't like the rel flat respons of the mic like the akg d112 and the ev re 20 i know they are more natur but that' usual not what i'm look for with kickdrum sound and they make me eq a lot the beta 52 and the audix d6 for my tast are a one trick poni they both have an overli agress curv that can be great for metal but whenev i want anyth a bit more rock sound and more natur their boost and scoop are simpli too much and i can't fix that with an eq the sennheis e602 ii wa a winner for me here it also ha a pre eq curv that boost sub frequenc and the beater sound but it' more natur and not as agres plu there is no sharp 5k bump like with the beta 52 i can get the 2 3k smack from it that i can't get from a 52 becaus it onli give me the click and make the kickdrum sound a bit like a black metal trigger the newer e902 ha a flatter curv that i would like for a bass amp but not for a kickdrum so i wa go to but an e602 ii what do you think about what i heard 3 tom the md421 is to expens and not veri function for live use i like both the e604 and the e904 from the test i heard and from my experi but i'm not veri certain that the e904 can be call an overal better microphon it' just differ it clean up highmid compar to the e604 becaus it ha a more broad hi mid boost but it take away more of the below 100hz materi and make lower tune floortom sound empti in short i don't think the e904 is better i think it' differ and for tom it seem to me i would in mani case prefer the 604 to the 904 but i like the metal build of the e904 and sometim i can use the extra 5k click i get from the 904 snare and smaller tom i can't make a decis here need advic i would buy 3 tom mic 4 guitar 57 so 57 is a classic a huge hi mid boost that add definit to the guitar and that can sometim be great so i will have one in my bag beyer m201tg the complet contrast to the 57 which i still consid amaz for the guitar is the beyerdynam m201tg much flatter curv slight mid boost at 2 3k rich lowmid i love it i would use it when a want a warmer tone that' not go to be ear pierc and overli defin senn e906 the best balanc between the two so unlik the beyer which is quiet flat the 906 ha a midrang bump but at about 3 4k and it' a lot milder then the 57 so it add definit to the guitar but it doesn't cover up the around 2k midrang by boost 5 6k a thousand db like a 57 it seem to me to be the best option when the guitar amp sound amaz and i don't want to alter it' sound i would now buy the e906 and later a 57 the beyer it seem to me i can cover all base with there 3 veri differ microphon 5 vocal 58 let' take the 58 as a standard and compar to it sennheis e835 seem to be on pair with a 58 slightli differ curv better for some vocal wors for some other vocal sennheis e935 damn amaz more defin and natur mid then a 58 worth the 200 euro pricetag fantast overal balanc i wa plan on buy a e835 3 pack or some 58' cheap both seem good and buy one e945 for fanci concert sinc i wouldn't give it to a punk singer,advice on buying a new set of microphone my experience so i work both in livesound and in a studio and
