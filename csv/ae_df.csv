Will I EVER understand compression...?,"Ahh yes, my monthly compression post...

I 'get' the idea of compression but I am struggling SO much with how to hear what is reasonable/appropriate/too much when adding compression. Here's my understanding and PLEASE correct me on any or all of this:

Threshold: The point where the plug in actually kicks in.

Ratio: How much of the sound over the threshold is compressed.

Attack: Length of time before Compression kicks in

Release: How long compression is held for

Makeup Gain: Getting the 'lost' volume back from the compression.

I'm trying to start with understanding the Logic house compressors, I've picked one to learn, Studio FET. 

My problem is, I can see the needle move and know something is happening but I just can't tell if I've found a sweet spot. Am I monitoring the WHOLE track while getting the compressor right or picking a particular good point where there might be loud words or soft words and looping it till I get it right? 

I've watched tons of videos, explanations, animations, you name it but I just can't get to grips with it. I think I need some exercises that will let me practice compression. I have a lot of recorded vocals and acoustic guitar, so plenty to work with, I just need to know what I'm listening for and how to know when I've done it 'right'...which I know is subjective. 

Also another question I have is, do you treat your compression like a mathematical equation? I find myself trying to do maths with the radio and db's blah blah blah...

"How do I know when a single sound is spectrally ""correct""?","Hi all! Thank you for your time!

I have a question that is more ""philosophical"" than technical.

How do I know when a single sound (or track) is ""ready"" or ""correct"" frequency-spectrum-wise? 
Is there any ""standard"" to satisfy every perception?
Is it just arbitrary? Or should I just reference it?

Two examples:

- I have this footstep on sand sound and I feel I should put an EQ on it because it doesn't sound like in the real life. I EQ it and I feel it is ok now. How do I know how much it is OK and ready to be put in a videogame? How do I know the high end is sparkly enough, for instance?

- I have this track and I reference it to another one in the same genre. I tweak it and now it sound very similar and very good to me. How can I trust that reference track of success? Why is it ok? Why is its spectrum good for everyone?

The most insane/bizarre source of random noise I've ever come across....,"&amp;#x200B;

So and my brother DJ, quite a complex setup - two laptops, two controllers, synced via an Ethernet cable, audio from both laptops into a tiny little 2-channel mixer, which then goes into monitor speakers.

For a while things were pretty crappy, so we just put up with the random noise from the big monitor wedge we use. It's pretty crap, but it's fine for rehearsing and when we play live we use the club's PA system, so we'd rather spend our money elsewhere.

Yet today I introduced a new laptop to the setup, and the noise was insane - really loud, really weird, it sounded like someone had placed a tiny microphone in the CPU and amplified the volume 10000 times.

I narrowed it down to everything - it wasn't the new cables, wasn't the controller/audio interface, it wasn't the little mixer.

The source - the new laptop's charger. When I unplugged it, the noise vanished. Zero background noise, very clean audio

It was slightly quieter when plugging the laptop into a totally different socket on the other side of the room, but still there. The noise ALSO still happens when the mini-mixer had that laptop's channel MUTED! I really don't get it...

Can someone help explain these drivers?,"Backstory, I’m not familiar with audio hardware but have some ee background. I have some old Bluetooth speakers with crappy audio and thought about changing the drivers with a some I got out of a broken monitor. The old speakers were in a sealed enclosure with matching passive radiators.

The drivers I got out of the monitor are rectangular and have some confusing acoustics. The sound clear when you face the drivers, but without much bass. But if you point them down, you can hear more bass, but less clarity. If i try to build a little portable enclosure for them, would they need to be in an unsealed enclosure, use the passive radiators, pointed down, or forward, etc? Just curious if anyone who is a familiar with this type of driver what the acoustic considerations are. Thanks

A) don't have the audio tech to improve microphones around that price range

B) marginal benefit decreases, so there's no point in improving audio quality if most buyers won't notice a difference

Why do guitar amp manufacturers advertise about how great their amps' bass frequency response is?,"It's relatively common for guitar amps to be advertised using phrases like ""huge, monstrous bass"" and other marketing terms regarding the impressiveness of how bass frequencies are reproduced by the amp. 

Is this a mere marketing gimmick oriented toward guitar players who either don't know or don't care how the amount of bass in their tone might interact negatively with the tone of the band's bassist? When guitar amp manufacturers advertise how great the bass response of their amp is, are they also necessarily referring to the extent to which their amp will compete with a bass guitar? 

I guess my question is whether an amp being advertised as having ""huge bass"" could translate into anything musically useful in the context of a band without necessitating that the bass guitar take up less space. If ""bass"" simply means frequencies from roughly 40 Hz to 300Hz, doesn't any advertisement about a guitar amps great bass presence mean that the bass guitar will have to be attenuated to compensate?",t2_9tmid,2,0
Mastering for Spotify?,"I've been working on a song for a friend of mine, and he wants to upload it to Spotify via Distrokid.

  
However, reading I've done suggests that spotify limits tracks to -14 LUFS, while the track I'm working on is currently peaking just under there. However, it is \*very\* quiet in comparison to a lot of stuff I've listened to, or even my own music on there - with the peak being around -5dB on the levels. 

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that it's a very dense mix, with a punk rock vibe. Low end rumble taken out, all the high end that wasn't audible in the mix shelved off. I've done everything I can to make sure everything is audible, and I'm happy with how it's sounding, but it's just too quiet relative to everything else on the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

The only option I can see is to turn the limiter gain up, but that will compromise the mix which I'm happy with.

Which bass trap design should I choose if I am using 111kg/m3 rockwool?,"I'm doing an across-the-board acoustic treatment of my loft. I recently came into 20m2 (65 feet) of 10cm (4 inch) thick rockwool (from a cladding company that didn't need it any more and were selling it off cheap.) I'm sorted for ceiling cloud, reflection points, rear wall... I know what I'm doing with them.

The place I'm struggling to make a decision is with my corner bass trap design - particularly the floor to ceiling corners. I have enough rockwool to stack triangles in every corner - floor to ceiling - and build a frame and cover them with fabric, but this is obviously a lot more effort than just building panels and having the straddle the corner with an air-gap.

Now, the rockwool I have is pretty dense and heavy. I just weighed a 60cm x 120cm x 10cm panel, and it was 8kg. (2 feet x 4 feet x 4 inches = 17.6 pounds). An online calculator tells me that the density is therefore 111kg/m3.

Confused about my fader readings and loudness,"I am mixing an album using Cubase 10 Pro.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently,  I have been getting a lot more into the nuts and bolts, specically DBFS, LUFS, and metering. The track in question has arrived to me from the studio quite quiet. After doing some mixing and balancing, I'm getting an integrated LUFS of -31. I noticed how quiet it was when I had to turn up my speakers to hear the rough bounce of the raw recording.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to get each track to peak at -18 on my fader's meter peak level. This is -18dbfs, which is a good target, right?

My my stereo out is peaking at around -12, yet my integrated LUFS is much lower.

So, a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I ever push the faders above 0? Is this an instance where I should?
2. When would I increase the gain in the channel settings instead of pushing the fader? What's the difference?
3. Does my mix have a lot of headroom? Does this mean that I can simply push the master fader when mastering to achieve a more standard LUFS?
4. What do I do with quiet tracks? in this particular song, there are brushes on the drums which need a bit of a boost. Currently I'm bringing the other tracks down to match, but this is resulting in a quiet mix overall.  How do you deal with quiet individual tracks that are too quiet for the mix?

"Home Recording: Analyzing Your Room's Acoustics to Get Flat vs. Making Your Room Sound ""Good"" To You","Plenty of us are home recording enthusiasts. It's a hobby we enjoy so much, that of coming home, layering many instruments together on a melody or progression we've been humming all day, getting that flow going and experimenting with new sounds. We want to create our lab, hand picking every piece of gear for a specific need and using it to death, learning everything we can.

The big part of research, is **how we get our room to sound**. Our monitors, of course, are affected by our room. Our recordings, whether they be vocals or some other acoustic instrument, are dependent on the acoustics of our room. But for most of us, that room is a bedroom, or an office, or some other space we need to be both liveable and aesthetically pleasing. 

Lately, **I've been identifying flutter echoes or high frequency build ups in my recordings,** find where the noise is coming from and slapping 2"" Rockwool or Fiberglass on it. I'm sure many have got to this step. 

Now I hear, ""hey the more high frequency reflections you eliminate, the more the low end ""modes"" will shine through. You should **get some Room Analysis Software** and Equipment to measure your room modes and rethink placement. Also, 4 inches is better than 2 inches.""

That's when I had my moment. **How far do I want to go?** Am I producer/recording artist? If so... **do I really need a ""perfect room""?** Or do **I just need to tame the flavor of my room**? Maybe I should pay other people to mix and master my music who already have the ""perfect"" sounding room.

building a studio in a rehearsal room,"hello everyone,

budget is low, why we won’t separate control room and studio or build a room in room construction. the idea is basically to record our band on multiple tracks while jamming or rehearsing and for the producers to have a somewhat nice sounding room while being able to record external musicians.

"Mixing EDM, am I doing this right and how can I improve?","Hey, I'm mostly drum &amp; bass/techno producer. I wanted to ask you for advice. This is my usual mixing process when producing a track.

I put limiter on the master so the max volume is -6db (I know I shouldn't but haven't found workaround yet). I rely mostly on audio levels because this works best for me. All elements in my tracks always have fixed volume levels:

\- kick and snare: -10db,

\- sub bass (sidechained) and mids: -14db,

\- percussions: -16db,

\- pads and synths: -20 to -16db,

\- cymbals and shakers: -24 to -21db

People often compliment my mixing and this works fairly well on deeper/calmer tunes, but when there comes a little more distortion and saturation the mix doesn't work quite right anymore. Do you know any useful tips and techniques?",t2_ma3v2,0,0
Is this a thing already?,"So I thought of a program that can be made (Unless it's already a thing) where you could build a floor plan and designate a spot where the audio source is coming from and the program would calculate the room, things in the room and the walls. Then it would apply the effects to make the sound fit the setting (E.g. reverb, eq, amplify, ect.). 

Say there was a narrator and you wanted him to sound like he was sitting next to or moving around you and your both in a church. With the program you could build the floor plan of the church and program the path of the voice, then the program would calculate the distance of the voice to apply any amplification, and if your subject walks around a wall the program would calculate the thickness and material of the wall and change the voice to match what it would accurately sound like. 


Is this a thing already and if it's not, why not? ",t2_12igvs,73,0
Using a single reverb/delay on all parts in a mix?,"I've toyed with this idea for a little while, but finally gone through with it; I set up my latest mixing project so that all of the individual components of the track (drums, guitar, 'body') go through a single reverb and delay auxiliary, to try and create a greater sense of cohesion and 'room' in the mix. It's hi-passed at around 4000Hz to cut out any low end rumble, and the bass doesn't go through it at all.

Recording keys with Keyscape,"Hi all. So, I'm a piano player that wants to record a few instrumental albums. I have limited working knowledge of DAWs and understanding of mixing/mastering.

What do you think would be the easiest way to accomplish this?

Had a breakthrough FOH mixing a dueling piano show.,"Been running sound for this dueling piano group for about a year now. The last several shows I’ve been feeling kind of bothered by the sound of the vocals. Nothing incredibly significant. The crowd always responded well to the show and to me the sound was acceptable, just not quite where i wanted it to be. 
Specifically I felt that a few of the singers always had an annoying “back of the throat” frequency (as I call it) at times. Been hunting it out during the shows as we don’t really do sound checks longer than a moment to get just the level. 
Tonight i finally got rid of it by simply scooping out a whole lot around 5k and I’m stoked! Exactly what i’ve been looking to get rid of. Vox sound so much smoother and less offensive to the ear.  
Seems like such an obvious simple fix now that I found it.  I’ve definitely just been too conservative about cutting in that range in the past.

I’ve been questioning lately if my ears are just super sensitive to high freq. because I work with other sound techs who don’t seem to be bothered by sibilance/ bitey freq. to the degree I am when they mix. I believe that I AM extra sensitive to it because I even notice it in a lot of professionally recorded/ mastered tracks (to a lesser degree than live music.)

I take good care of my ears. (wear my molds after I get the mix dialed in/take frequent breaks when I’m mixing recordings) 

Anyway this is all just to say I’m excited about my realization and to remind my fellow aspiring engineers to not be afraid to get aggressive when you feel it is needed.

Stadium Concert was such a waste of money. Please help me understand why?,"Hey engineers! Long time reader, first time poster. Still building my knowledge. 

I just saw Bon Jovi play at ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Australia.
I was sitting in the balcony on stage left about 100ft back. The sound was so bad that I ended up leaving before the Encore because it just wasn't worth hanging around and fighting the crowds.
I paid $200 for those tickets (complete robbery that venues can charge now) and I could barely make out that it was even Bon Jovi playing. It just felt like every frequency was clashing with one another and there was no clarity. You literally couldn't understand the vocalist or anything he said to the audience in between songs. It was so bottom heavy. 
It totally ruined the show for me. I really want to know why this happened? Because after I left and went outside to head back to the car park, the sound was so much better OUTSIDE THE DAMN VENUE!!!
Was I in some sort of reverb trap? Was I in between every set of speaker? Should venues be allowed to sell tickets where the sound gets crossed over that much? We all know the dreaded Snare delay (where you hear it 0.3 milliseconds behind you when they play). 
I just want to know how to completely avoid those areas next time I buy tickets for a stadium show.

TLDR: the sound at Bon Jovi was so bad where I was sitting that it ruined the night and I left before the end. Why?? How can I avoid those seats?

Whenever I do live sound for shows and a DJ sends me the instrumentals, I always EQ out some of that harsh trap Hi-Hat sound.

Should all single driver speakers be equally useful for mix checking?,"Hoping not as much for purchase advice as I am hoping for discussion about what makes a good mix checker single driver speaker. This way this thread could be informative for many people. People with more experience than me (most of you I'm guessing) please chime in. By single driver I mean just a woofer, no tweeter, no crossover. It can be in mono or stereo or surround but the third seems unlikely.

 I haven't found much factual information about the utility of various such speakers, just people saying ""this is good, buy it with my Amazon affiliate link so I get money"".

I've seen the occasional post about this topic on here. Some people say why use a mix cube when you can just buy some of the top rated computer speakers from Amazon (the top 3 are all under $25), and that mix cubes etc are a relic of the past since they are closer to PA systems which aren't one of the primary music playback forms today. Others say these pro audio speakers aren't just shitty speakers, they actually have very good transient response, etc, but then I wonder, how do you know if the mix will sound good on slower responding speakers?

Also is there a consensus on whether the single driver mix check speakers should be used in mono or stereo? There are a variety of systems that are each.

Some popular consumer speakers (mainly computer speakers) are single driver. I think phone speakers and laptops are as well, correct? Also the low end earbuds many people use are single driver. Meaning that most of the public is using shitty single driver devices. Is this the importance of checking with single driver devices?

Similarly there is the Avantone Mix Cube, etc, products designed for professional use. 

In 2018 is there a reason for using a pro audio oriented single driver speaker like the Avantone over a low end consumer oriented speaker as far as mixing? Also when do you decide to use the mix check speaker and what for? Setting levels, reverb, effects, etc or just checking the mix to see if bass, etc dissappear?",t2_2qh4yows,1,0

And lo and behold, theres A7X. Im not gonna type a long essay explaining their recording process since there are lots of videos where they explained it themselves but to make a long story short, they, as well as their production team, have very innovative recording methods.

They deviate from the usual and come up with new ways that works for them. The drums on their 2  latest albums (TS and HTTK) were both raw yet powerful, deviating from the electronic/triggered drums most bands go for. All their albums has optimal bass levels fitted to their respective sound. Heck,even their debut album (w/c I dislike), was recorded in a "" raw punk style"" of recording even tho the songs were metalcore.

Advice on easy bang-for-my-buck recording at home,"Amateur hobbyist here. I wanted to get back into recording again and update my setup so it's better this go round. A few years ago I used an old-as-heck M-Audio preamp (circa 2004 maybe?), Sony Acid 6, and an MXL 4000 Multi-Pattern FET Studio Condenser mic. 

I had multiple problems that I'd appreciate some help solving: 



1. This setup didnt pick up high quality vocal peaks and sound unless I sang way too loud and that compromised my ability to sing since Im already not much of a singer anyway. If I sang softly it would pick up too much bg static hum.... Whats going on with that? Do I need a better preamp or mic or what? Id love to be able to adjust it to pick up low sounds without that whishing in the background.

2. When i recorded on Acid, it would always put my recording slightly behind the beat. I dont know what causes this, do you? If it's a ram issue,I just upgraded my ram to 16gb. If it's an issue with Sony Acid, whats an easy program I can learn without much training?

Basically I'm looking to fix these problems without spending much more money. Good enough is good enough. But if my preamp, mic, program, or a combination of them is causing the volume problems and lag, how can I fix it cheaply?

I have searched for this extensively on google, but haven't found any solutions, so either what I want is impossible, or I'm using searching for the wrong thing, as it seems unlikely that I'm the first person to want to do this.

Long version with details: 

I'm creating audio recordings of surveys that will be used for research and quality control. We currently use SoX to record because of the command line capabilities, meaning we can use our survey administration software to automatically turn on recording when participants give consent. 

I'd really like to find a way to add chapter markers (or similar embedded data) about where specific survey questions start within the file. This would hopefully allow researchers and quality control staff to quickly find a single question in a large audio file. For this to be practical, I need to be able to pass this information via command line while the recording is being created. I don't think SoX can do this, but perhaps someone here has ideas on whether this can be accomplished with other tools?

I'm not wed to any specific file format. We currently use Mp3, but if there is a solution available for this, I'm already assuming I need to change to a different format. 

The surveys we conduct range in length between 45 minutes and 3 hours, and we conduct thousands of surveys per year, so editing chapter markers in post is out of scope. I have considered breaking the recordings into many single-question files, but this would mean creating hundreds of files per survey administered, so file management could be cumbersome. Additionally, some questions are very short (only a few seconds) and we have had issues with SoX cutting off the final couple seconds of some files. It seems when we create a new file it discards whatever is in the buffer at that time instead of writing it to the file. So far this has been an acceptable level of data loss, as we currently only split each survey into a few tracks (due to our experience with SoX becoming unstable with Mp3 tracks over ~90 minutes in length). However, it would not be acceptable to lose the final seconds of every question we administer because that would often mean losing the answer given by the survey participant. 

Thanks for reading and considering this problem.",t2_dhfk2,0,0

Recording on 8-track with stereo instruments: conserving tracks,"This seems like a very basic question, but I wasn't able to find a straight answer through search.

Fatness in a mix in the wrong places?,"Hey guys, having a bit of a problem.

Mixing an alt rock track yesterday and got it to where I thought it was great, then did some references. 

In my reference tracks, the drums are nice and crisp, but the bass is fat and full. In my mix, the drums are a little muddy and the bass is crisp but slightly lacking. The multitracks were the best recordings I’ve made in my life so far (IMHO), and I’m happy overall with the progress. But this is irritating me - I feel the drums are 99% there but there’s something missing, like the sustain of snares etc. But when I compress it a little harder (even with a longer attack and release) it just loses that punch. I’m trying to avoid parallel compression for the minute if I can.

Best Mixing Analogy Ever! Mixing is like pizza...,"Mixing is like pizza. All nice and neat like Dominoes...sucks!  Best pizza's in the world are always a little sloppy looking.   
The best MIXING lesson I learned many years ago, was when the producer fell asleep, and me and the artist spent all night finishing the mix. We had it 'perfect'. Then the producer, Randy Muller, woke up about 6am, and said ""let me see what you got"". After he heard it, he turned to us and said ""congratulations, you have an A+ in mixing. Everything is perfectly in it's place"". So we were happy. For a moment. Then he said, ""but I get no feeling from it, nothing is jumping out, there's no grit or dirtiness, and we have to start over!"" Or something like that. So I made a DAT copy of what we had, and thought there was no way we were going to beat our mix. And about 4 hours later, when we thought we had it, I compared it to what we spent all night on, and the new mix KILLED our old one!!! It was so much more exciting.   
So my point is...don't overmix. You can make things a little raw, let some dynamics pop out, and don't be so safe! Perfect in NOT perfect!

For example, I am working on an album where there's a short intro track that needs to be very dynamic and also kinda quiet compared to the following songs. I've measured it to about -22 LUFS (and I refuse to make it louder), so I'm afraid there's going to be a problem on playback if the rest of the tracks are -14, probably with the intro being normalized way up and throwing off the whole vibe.

How do dual output synths give stereo width?,"Hey guys,  


lately I've been asking a lot of questions, and trying to understand stereo width better. I have been struggling with guitar width and grasping that it is a mono signal so the best you can do is use effects to create a difference between hard panned signals, or you can double track the same part.   


But my question is then for something like a DX7 or any hardware synth, how do the patches on there have stereo width? Like a tine piano sound on my DX7 sounds so nice and full and wide with no perceivable phase cancellation between each side. Specifically what is happening in the sound card of that DX7 that makes the sides different enough to not cancel out when spread wide hard L and hard R? Is it micro discrepancies in pitch? or timing?

How does a Roland JC120's Stereo output work?,"The title says it all.

And wouldn't this cause phase issues? When I ask about simulating that in my DAW doing just that (L = wet, R= Dry hard panned) people say that's a bad move because it causes phasing issues in mono. Is there a time delay on one side built into the JC120?  


On that same vein, how does a classic Rhodes piano, which to my understanding outputs mono, become stereo on so many recordings? Two mics on the amp? Wouldn't there be phase issues then as well?

Speeding up/slowing down tracks by percentages,"Hey folks.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully someone can help me and my soft brain with this query. Essentially, we're shooting a music video tomorrow and the director has requested that I make some slowed down and sped up versions of the song so we can shoot to those. They've asked for a variety of different speeds but I'm having a little difficulty wrapping my head around the percentages. I wanna make sure I get this right and that we aren't in for some nasty surprises in post!

The best way to articulate my query is with an example I suppose. For one of the versions, she would like a render at 51.1% speed. I'm using Logic which has a vari-speed function but you can't just set it at 51.1% of the tempo, you can only subtract or add percentages. I am right in presuming that subtracting 48.9% off the original track would be the same thing as setting it at 51.1%? I'm just very wary of screwing this up so wanted to get a second opinion with the dastardly percentages!

Studio Engineering with a disability?,"Hi, this community seems really helpful so I thought I'd ask here.

I won't go into too much detail, but I have a degenerative disabilty which targets my hands and feet. After ten years of playing piano and making music, I've come to find that my ability to play is starting to worsen due to the wasting it's causing in my hand muscles. It's saddening and has been hard to come to terms with as I'm still only young, but I've decided to shift my focus towards music production and studio engineering, as it'll still enable me to play a role in the music creation process without necessarily being able to play an instrument (of course I have good aural skills and good theory knowledge still).

I've done a bit of assistant engineering work in the studio near me and have been able to watch the lead engineer work and also help out where I can. I seem to be able to manage fine, with the one exception being with mic stands. I don't have very good grip or much fine motor control in my fingers, which makes tightening the different sections of the stand with the screws and things quite difficult. I have a similar issue with mic clips, too. I've had to ask for help with these things. The lead engineer at the studio knows about my condition and is very understanding, but I feel like not everybody will be so understanding

Do any of you guys here know of any devices or tips that might help? It's a really minor thing, but if I can't do something as simple as setting up a mic stand without asking for help, I feel like I'm not going to be received so well by other engineers, as well as clients.

There's also issues that may arise with heavy lifting - amps, bulky instruments etc, which can't really be helped, beyond having the equipment in position beforehand. But the stand thing is most importnat for me at the moment.

Advice on recording vocals in a small room,"I've been thinking about how to go about recording vocals in my bedroom, but I live in a tight space - 9'11"" by 4'10"" (ceiling is 7'9"") which is mostly taken up by my bed/closet/work station.

I know people aren't here for turning closets into vocal booths but I'm willing to spend decent money for acoustic treatment.

So should I opt for treating my bedroom - which will probably have to lead to sealing my window or something - or making a closet booth and adding a vocal filter?

"Is there anything ""wrong"" with running a (external) preamp into an (audio interface) preamp?","**Short version:** Most consumer audio interfaces do not have line inputs that bypass a preamp stage. What issues can you expect (if any) if you were to route an external preamp into an audio interface channel with a preamp?

**Long version:** I have an external preamp I like to use (Focusrite ISA One). I've been using it with a Steinberg UR44 which has two line inputs with no preamp stage. Perfect! However, I needed more I/Os than the UR44 offered, so I picked up a Focusrite Scarlett 18i20. The problem is, the Scarlett 18i20 doesn't have any line inputs that bypass the preamps (in fact, it seems most consumer level audio interfaces with lots of IOs do not offer line inputs that bypass a preamp stage). So if I were to use my Isa One, I'd have to connect to one of the Scarlett preamps, thus the mic signal now going through 2 preamp stages.

The interwebs seems split on whether or not this matters, especially with pres like the ones on the Focusrite that are meant to be transparent.

So... is this even something worth worrying about? Is anyone out there sending an external preamp signal through one of their audio interface preamps to get tracked onto your DAW? I've been eyeing a few other external pres, but I don't want to spend money on things that will be negatively affected by my audio interface situation. Or is their something I can connect to the Scarlett's ADAT in/out that doesnt have pres?

\- making sure the mics don't peak, especially given I have to pick up audio loud enough to get discussion from the band AND soft enough not to be overloaded by the band (which is a rock band - drums, bass, etc);

To the people that didn't wear earplugs to concerts/clubs when they were in their teens. Do you feel an impact on your hearing today?,"First off I want to mention I'm a person that generally has a tendency to worry a little too much about things.

Until about 8 months ago when I started producing music I stupidly never wore ear protection to clubs/bars which I would visit once a week on average. Luckily I never had temporary tinnitus or any other sign of a hearing issue except a couple days ago when I did a basic hearing test at home I noticed that the threshold for hearing a sine tone at a certain frequency is about 2db higher on my right ear. This got me a bit concerned since I'm looking forward to studying audio engineering. 

I will go to an audiologist soon to have the actual damage assessed professionally and hope it's only minor.

Newbie question - Calculating loudness of two or more audio sources,"I'm not very familiar with audio engineering, so please go easy on me if this is a stupid question.

I'm using OBS Studio for creating youtube videos and this program allows me to use plugins on individual audio tracks (e.g. windows audio, mic audio), but not on the master track. By using my plugins i can set every individual track to continiously adjust to a certain loudness value, but not the master track.

Knowing the individual loudness of two or more tracks in lufs, and wanting the resulting master mix to be at -13 lufs, how much loudness should each track have? In essence, **how do i add loudness values** **from individual tracks** to find the overall loudness of a mix?",t2_713ip,4,0

"Snares/claps sound super ""sharp"" and cause ear fatigue/pain even at low levels ?","Hello,  


I recently fell in love with mixing after being intimidated from it for a long time. Feels so great to finally see progress in it. Lately I've been mixing a lot, but my snares and drums often sound super harsh and bright. I have a roommate, so if I want to mix at night, I have to use headphones (Sony MDR-7506s), but even at super low levels, my ears start to hurt (mostly from snares and claps) after 15-20 minutes.   


Are there certain frequencies I need to be cutting? Is it possible that I'm just not controlling my high end at all? Most of my mixing is about clearing up the low end. I don't often see advice about handling the high end of mixes? Am I missing some information.  


In addition, I saw someone say that they think soundcloud destroys their high end, but It think in general, alll of my mixes have sounded better once I upload to soundcloud. This probably (definitely) means I need a lot more practice mixing, but could this also point out that I have way too much high end in my mix?

Amount of people in the studio,"Do you ever set a limit? 
Some sessions it’s like the artists (like one person) brings family friends kids and their producer, and their dealer.

It’s gets so distracting having like 20 people in the control room. Between baby cries, phone conversations, YouTube videos, and the sound of mouth noises from chips being eaten it drives me crazy. 

I could seriously punch someone mid session from it and many times stop because it’s sensory overload. 

Has anyone else gone through this? What do you do?

Made it through the session, aaaand someone broke into the studios office and stole the cash for the 10 hour session. Thank the stars I didn’t give the artist anything. So now it’s their job to find who took that money and get it to us. I’m probably going to cancel tomorrow’s session they booked just because someone was snooping around where they weren’t supposed to and it’s kind of killed the chill vibe from working with them.

A voice with a bad *recorded* noise reducer,"Let me begin this by saying. My area of expertise is music and this is a video of 15 minutes I'm working on.

Now for some reason when they recorded the video and more importantly, the audio. They set a noise reducer on everything. This created a kinda ""sush-ing"" sound on the voices and I've tried to remove it with parallel compression and with eq. And I wasn't able to. 
What I did to ""solve"" the issue was play with the background noise enough  for it not to be heard but I did wanna see if anyone had had an issue like this before and how you solved it.

Does distortion inherently increase brightness?,"I'm just trying to figure out if my assumptions and understanding are true on the topic. It seems to me that it's a double whammy:

* Both clipping distortion and harmonic distortion increase higher frequency content because they generate harmonics in various orders.
* A lot of psychoacoustic things come into play: complex waveforms are easier to hear than more sinusoidal ones, higher frequencies (up to a point) are easier to hear and identify direction on, etc.

De-essing while tracking?,"I recently bought an Apollo Twin and am looking forward to having the capability to record while using plugins.

However, I don't know if I should record vocals with a de-esser, or do that processing later.  I would probably use the de-esser before the LA-2A, so those peaks don't effect the LA-2A as much.

Are there remasters that actually made a world of difference compared to their previous release or were they all just ""meh""?

Two part question; Does not having a true ground (electrical outlets) add a lot of noise to mic preamps? /What can I do to reduce preamp noise,"So I am looking at getting the SM7b for gaming/streaming/general voice chat (yes I know it's overkill, but I like to go over the top with things). I currently have a Behinger X18 digital mixer. I was going to get the Cloudlifter CL-1 for the SM7b to add some (hopefully) clean signal. However, I'm afraid I will still have too much noise. When I turn the gain up on my X18 mixer with nothing plugged in, there is a decent amount of [hiss](https://clyp.it/yz0kn0cy?token=6b7ca630a7b2d07e40f9fb299064dfaa). That is with the preamp gain set to +60.

What can I do to get a cleaner signal if I decide to get the SM7b that requires a lot of gain? I wasn't sure if this has anything to do with it, but the house I'm renting is ungrounded. I know the preamps in this aren't the best in the world, but they are supposed to be Midas designed (whatever that means). I do see people recommend the dbx 286s instead of the cloud lifter, but I don't think I want to spend the extra money on that. I can already do gate/compression/everything on the X18 mixer.

Did I just damage my new yamaha monitors?,"Hey guys, I just recently bought a pair of the Yamaha HS7s and was super excited to set them up. At first I originally set them up correctly with the XLR inputs connected to my focusrite interface and everything sounded amazing. But today, I found a spare aux to dual 1/4"" cable and had the dumbest idea to hook up them up along with the XLR inputs so I could also play music on my phone. (I know I know... I should've read the manual that clearly states not to use both inputs at the same time). For some reason I thought they'd be able to handle switching between the inputs automatically. So I plugged both of the inputs in and I noticed that the volume dropped by around half when playing audio through the XLR inputs and also there was a high pitch noise coming from the monitors whenever my phone was connected to the 1/4"" inputs but the volume was normal. This is when I figured something was wrong and read the manual and immediately disconnected the 1/4"" inputs...

Peaking within plugins or in between plugins but no clipping—is this ok?,"So just like the title says, is it ok for plugins to peak as long as everything is turned down at the end of the chain?

I’ll give an example.  Say I have a compressor, I’m pushing it pretty hard and the meter in the plugin is hitting red.  But it’s not clipping.  I’ll usually pull it down to keep it out of the red before continue processing the signal.  Is this necessary?

Sometimes it’s not peaking on the plugin’s meter but I’ll have an eq set up after my compression and the “in” signal on the eq is peaking.  Should I turn down the compressor, or can just turn down my in signal on the eq?  Sometimes it’s fine in the plugin but the track meter is peaking... but I can’t hear any clipping. Should I turn down down the track or tweak my plugins so they don’t push the signal too hard?

Often, even though there’s no peak in the plugin, I’ll have to turn down the plugin so my signal is not peaking the “in” of a plugin after it.  Does this matter or should I be more concerned with actual clipping?  

Assuming there’s no audible clipping, at what stage should I be concerned about being in the red? Can I just slap a limiter after my my cranked compressor or at the end of my effects chain?  Or do I have to be super meticulous and make sure the signal isn’t peaking at each stage of processing, even though there’s no clipping? ",t2_xowqr,8,0

Will hearing loss afect my mixing?,I have hearing loss and I've been mixing for quite some time. I try to treat my ears good. Keeping a low volume on everything except mixing (turning down hearnaid levels or turning off when I don't need it). Also not sleeping with background noise. I'm scarred it will still affect my ears and will make them worse faster. Anyone else in my shoes. Any response is appreciated.,t2_wzeat,70,0
how can i fairly compare volume difference comparisons in field recording?,"example, i want to reference how loud a gun is from a far distance, so i play a ringtone from a phone a few feet from the mic while the shot goes off. the phone gives a reference of how strong the gain is on the mic. i just want a way to show what something sounds like, without the viewer not knowing how loud to have their listening volume.  basically, if the reference sound is something everyone knows, they can reasonably compare the target sound. i hope i make sense. my question is what kinds of sounds would be good to use as the phone in this example?",t2_12dy9x,1,0
No New Gear November is giving me BAD G.A.S.,"How do you all deal with G.A.S.?  I've got a Lindell Audio 17XS MkII compressor that I love to use, but for the sake of doing a quick bass track for a Riders on the Storm cover, I skipped the comp for the recording and just mic'd the amp for a straight signal.  In Studio One I went ahead and smashed it with the Waves DBX Compressor plugin and it sounds fat.  Like really good.  This unfortunately made me question whether I should sell my comp and by a few mics and a pedal I've been eyeing (SM57, E906, Sennheiser E904, and the Belle Epoch Delay Pedal).  I think it's just because I haven't bought gear in a loooooong time.  What do you do to get over your G.A.S.?",t2_ifhtomx,3,0

What are your techniques for identifying empty space in a mix?,"Everybody always talks about identifying regions that're too full, but what about regions that are too empty? If a mix is a little thin and I can't immediately figure out what needs to be added I'll usually solo a pretty thin band (high Q) on the master and sweep through trying to find space (both in mono and stereo). I find though that this method can confuse you since one band might be louder than the others and so when soloing you kind of loose sense of dymanics. I'm wondering what are some other methods for identifying space in a mix?",t2_gfkig,6,0
Completely handicapped by production/engineering disability,"Hi there.

I’m a decently proficient musician (if I don’t say so myself...) but my ability to capture, produce, and engineer a digital reflection of my performances these days, despite a quality rig, is embarrassingly poor.  I feel like each piece of equipment and digital tech requires a new skill set on par with learning a whole new instrument and I just don’t have the time or internal impetus. 

My current goal is to have a halfway decent recording of a new album of singer/songwriter material with guitar and vocals (2-4 tracks, 15ish songs).  I want to capture video as well and pair it with the audio.  

These recordings don’t have to be amazing, just decent enough to send to the copywrite office, share with friends and family via YouTube, SoundCloud etc.  Down the road, I’ll may throw a chunk o’ change at a pro studio to do all this for me but for now, I just want to keep it simple, time efficient, cheap(ish) and build some momentum.  

I have the sound I want (or close) live:  guitar, effects, fishman DI, fishman loudbox artist; vocals, Neumann mic, tc helicon processor, fishman loudbox.  

If I try to record directly into my studio recording rig I just can’t get the same sound, mix, vibe, as I do live.  No doubt, this is due to technical ineptness/naïveté. 

How bad an idea is it to just record my live performances with a condenser mic in front of my fishman amp with minimal post production.  Do people do this?  

Studio rig:  loaded 2018 Mac book pro, universal audio apollo 8xp interface, akg C214 LDC mic.

Pre mastered snare sample being smashed when mastering,"Searched every thread online for a solution.

Is this a viable way to reamp a guitar?,"I know the ideal method would be just buying a Reamp box. However, I figured I would try to get around the need by doing this: working on a Focusrite Scarlett 6i6, guitar recorded directly into Logic. After I got the guitar recorded, I made a separate audio track to record into. Then, I got a guitar cable, connected one end to the headphone jack of my interface. The other end went into the input of my guitar amp. Mic’ed up the amp, and I set it to record. I expected that this would be potentially dangerous with feedback, so I made the amp as quiet as possible, because as I expected, after a certain point of loudness I got feedback and almost blew out the speakers. I managed to get the guitar track reamped successfully, but only with the amp playing at about a soft speaking level. I know this is a pretty stupid method, but is there anything different I could do next time to be able to push the amp to a louder level without getting feedback? I tried muting the audio track that I was recording into and stuff like that but it didn’t work",t2_zlpwg,0,0

Good uses for Flanger?,"Hey guys,  


I'm wondering what are some good uses for flanger besides the 'woooshing' shoe gazy air plane take off long sweeps, and the warbly little almost vibrato sounding shorter sounds. I've never seemed to be able to get this effect somewhere in a mix where I think it was really adding anything. And maybe it's the style of music I make... more soul R&amp;B, but I figure there has to be *some* spot for it in a mix used for subtlety. On vocals maybe?

Low Ohm headphones for tracking,"Tell me what you think about this:  It is preferable to use Low Ohm headphones so you can get them plenty loud without cranking the preamp level on your interface.

SD9 Insert Issues,"Hey there, 
Lately i've been experiencing a strange issue with my DiGiCo SD9. We use a Waves Soundgrid server basically just as a network-based interface to get multi-track audio from to our Livestreaming computer running Logic. The issue has been that lately, it seems certain channels have been un-routing the returns from the SG server.

It took a while to track down what the issue was. I was seeing input on the meters, but couldn't hear anything from that channel on any of the mixes/groups/PFL bus. 

It first happened a few months back on only one channel, and I couldn't figure it out at the time so I just loaded an older session and worked from there and it was fine. This last Sunday though, it un-routed two separate channels (7 &amp; 25). Today when I came in to mix for an event, I had to re-route the inserts on all of my FX returns (37-42).

I haven't been able to find any cause for this really. I know there's the toggle for the insert that's to the right hand of the EQ strip, but if someone were to accidentally bump it, it would only turn off the insert, not actually un-route it. 

Is this something that anyone else has experienced? I know the way that I use the SG server isn't the most typical scenario, but i'm hoping someone can sympathize/tell me why this seems to be happening.

TL;DR random channels are un-routing the insert returns and I can't figure out why.",t2_56ugoku,2,0

Does my vintage speakers Philosophy actually make sense?,"My friend who got me into the audio engineering world always bought vintage speakers and gear. I soon followed. Not only was it more fun to go to flea markets and scour Facebook yard sale sites for this gear then instead of endlessly watching reviews of new bookshelf speakers and so on. Another thing was that the music we liked to play was from those areas. I’m a big Beatles fan and he is a big Rush fan, So We had this idea that using the high end gear from back then (60’s to mid 80’s) would result in getting what the audio was trying to sound like back then. Let me give an example. When rush released their debut album it was 1974 so we wanted to listen to it like it was  1974. We felt the audio was more authentic being played on a pair of speakers from the 70’s. The question I’m asking is does this make sense and does it actually enhance the music or is it just an excuse for me to keep buying vintage gear. Thanks!",t2_25usgyaj,1,0

What are your go-to reference songs for mixing?,"I heard a great snippet from [Greg Wells' Q&amp;A with the MWTM youtube channel](https://youtu.be/JM9CFU6_Q64?t=1182) about making a playlist of your most favourite mixes that inspired me to ask.... What are your go-to reference songs for mixing?  

What mixes really impress you and inspire you? What do you think is the best of the best in terms of sonic quality?

___

Here's the quote if anybody's curious: 

&gt; Jack Joseph Puig told me many years ago that he makes a playlist of his favourite sounding mixes, and while he’s mixing he will go to that playlist and switch the input and through the speakers he’s hearing other people’s mixes from records that he really adores and loves, and then he’ll go back to his mix. And that can be a REAL quick bucket of water to the face of objectivity. In the first few years it’s so humbling. I call it “Mix reality playlist”.",t2_3orlh,5,0
Recording Drums : Question,"Hey Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping I could get some helping weighing in on my Choice for recording Drums. (Two Toms, Snare, Kick and Hi-hat and Cymbals)

I am working on recording the drums for our band, and have access to these particular items at the moment

&amp;#x200B;

2 condenser mics ( 2 x AT2020)

4 Dynamic mics ( 2 x SM57s and 2 x SM58s)

&amp;#x200B;

Where it gets a little tricky:

&amp;#x200B;

I own an Avid Mbox 3 Pro (4 inputs) and one of these : \[mono mixers\]([https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01F6PTA04/ref=oh\_aui\_detailpage\_o06\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01F6PTA04/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1))

this is used on my recently built PC (firewire card FTW)

&amp;#x200B;

I also have an Mbox 2 - with Pro tools 8 LE installed on a laptop.

&amp;#x200B;

should I?

A) Solely use the Mbox 3 pro? (so two Overheads P48 in Input 1 and 2, kick in input 3 and use input 4 to run Snare and two Toms on the same input)

or

B) Use the Mbox 3 pro for the Overheads, Kick and snare and use the Mbox 2 for the High tom and Floor Tom?)

&amp;#x200B;

Since both my PC and Laptop have decent specs - and I can import the Tracks from one session to another, I am leaning towards the B - as it would allow me to individually control everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I safe to assume this is the better option?

Recording a drum during practice,"Hi folks. The band I play in is currently discussing the possibility of recording our practice sessions. We're not too concerned with sound quality seeing as this is really just intended to improve our playing in various ways. We already have a digital mixer, and everybody except the drummer is either already plugging into it, or has a cab-simulated DI built-into their amps.

So the major problem that's left to solve is that we need to record a live drummer, while 4 other musicians are playing in the same small practice room at the same time (through amps and a pair of powered speakers). Ideally without spending hundreds of dollars on equipment. 

I have a decent cardioid mic (AT2020) at home that's currently gathering dust. If I point it towards the drum kit and away from everything else, are we going to get a fairly clear recording? Or is it just going to pick up a ton of noise and sound like muddied shit? If so, could we fix this with noise gates, EQing or black magic?

Understanding MIDI set-ups is proving difficult,"I have done a bunch of research trying to answer this myself but a clear answer eludes me given most OPs are unclear what exactly they want answered. I will keep this as pointed as possible, and any help would be greatly appreciated.

**My precise goal:** Use the MIDI out on my regular weighted digital piano (keyboard) into a computer one way or another such that I can use an interface to change the keyboard voices and use the keyboard keys to create drum sounds or whatever else, e.g. G4 might be a cymbal, E4 might be a snare, like a MIDI controller but less user friendly.

**Points of confusion:**

1. I haven't even worked out to what degree that is doable or practical, which I suppose depends whether software like Ableton or whatever can accommodate this easily.

2. Similarly, while expensive, is it easier just to buy a MIDI controller to this end?

I think part of the confusion comes out of some recommendations on this site I saw to avoid certain MIDI to USB cables, and caveats about lag which are all well taken. Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.",t2_uiopj,0,0
Will this fry my audio interface?,"So I have these earbuds that I got with my Galaxy S8 and they have a mic built in and all, and I've connected them to my Audient iD14. They are like, your usual 1/8 headphone TRRS jack and I plugged them into a 1/4 TRS jack adapter and they were not working properly, the sound was quiet for some reason and all, but when I hold any button on the control panel of the earbuds the sound turns normal. I guess it's because there's both mic and headphones on single jack and trying to connect it to a TRS (not TRRS) adapter causes the 'buds to malfunction. Soooo, my question is, is it safe for the interface to plug headphones like that in? Or will fucking around with the jacks fuck the interface up?

Three mic drum recording question,"I'm setting up a semi-permanent mic mix for a performance space/live room at my house and would like some opinions. I'm going to run the bass direct off the DI, I have a Sennheiser E609 mics on the cabs of both guitar amps and am running a stereo sub-mix of vocals from Shure SM58s. All tracks are going into a FocusRite Scarlett 18i20 with a computer set up strictly for recording to Reaper.

We have occasional open mics, open jams and house shows for which we will be recording audio to mix down and send to a video feed. That leaves me three channels remaining for the drum mic setup without adding on additional preamps via optical (Which I may do down the line).

I have a Shure Beta 52A, two Blue Sparks, two SM57s and four Blue Encore 100is available in my arsenal. To create as clean a mix as possible would I be better off micing the kick with the 52A, snare with one of the Encores (or an SM57) and a single Spark as a room mic or micing the kick and using the additional two channels to set up the Sparks in an XY pattern overhead?

The room is about 30'x70' and the stage area is 10'x20' in the Northwest corner with a brick wall behind the stage. We have two Alto TS212s and a sub for the mains and two Yorkville 12"" monitors flown from the ceiling angled at 60 degrees from parallel to the floor and the room has minimal sound treatment.",t2_69j4p,1,0

Podcast post production,"I’ve been asked to do post production on a friend’s podcast. There were three people each on an SM58 recorded into a Zoom hard disc recorder in a flat (apartment) with no acoustic treatment.

I’ve EQed each channel but the box I was is coming from the mics that aren’t in use at that time. The podcast is 45 mins long so too long to do automation. Anybody got any ideas to get a decent sound (save re-recording the whole thing in an actual studio!)

"Arranging a track that is mostly guitars, tone, effects, etc.","Hey guys,

I am working on some tracks that have most of their harmonic content coming from guitars ( 2+ different chord inversions, and rhythms of extended chords, and one bass guitar). This is more of a general question, but I am wondering how you fill out an arrangement for a song that is mostly guitar? To my ears, there's a certain narrowness to the electric guitar playing chords that something like an electric piano Rhodes sound doesn't have. Narrow in width but also frequency content. A thinness that a few interlocking synth chords doesn't have. When combined in a full arrangement, with keys and maybe strings or pads and other instruments, guitars do a nice job of accentuating certain parts of the harmony through chord stabs and fills, but when it is just guitar, it seems to not fill the wide frequency range that a piano or keys would, and it also doesn't have an attack that naturally lends itself to 'holding down' an arrangement as well either. And this is coming from someone who has played guitar for 15 years. I know my instrument and I know it's short comings. I am also wondering how you manage arrangement situations as far as what effects, and 'differences' you put on the guitars to make them fill out an arrangement - or what playing style in comparison to the other you encourage.So how do you deal with a creating a song that has that fullness but is harmonically carried only by electric guitars?

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Im going for a sort of R&amp;B/Soul/smooth jazz sound. A lot of guitar recommendations for production come for things that in my head make sense in a two distorted guitar panned hard type scenario, sort of a rock/metal world if you will. And that's cool. I've done that to success before. But I'd rather have someone think in the lines of these genres I'm mentioning (which in my mind rely heavily on the E.Piano sounds to carry the harmony) and think again how this can be achieved with just guitars. Thanks!",t2_4nja4,1,0
What do you all use for sound absorption/diffusion?,"Hi everyone, sorry in advance if this isn’t the right sub to post this in. 
I have a second story garage ‘studio’ that needs some TLC as far as sound absorption goes. This space is used as a practice area for my band, as well as where I work on editing music. Of course, no young persons studio is complete without a neighbor who absolutely hates the sound leakage. I know the first thing people might recommend is to find a new place to practice, but at this time that’s not an option for me, unfortunately. I understand that there’s no way to completely soundproof the room, but I have a very thick blanket in front of and around the drums and I recently purchased some safe n sound rockwool, which I’m planning on making panels with this week. I’m sure some people here have made some panels with rockwool, so I was mainly wondering what kind of fabric will work best for wrapping the panels once the frames are built. This is important for me to know as I’ve heard a lot of different suggestions. 

Also if you guys have any other suggestions as to what I could do to contain some (or most) of the sound, I’m open to anything! My band stops practice at 9, since the town I live in has no sound ordinance, so we abide by the sound law of the state that we live in. My neighbor must have crazy good hearing because when I stood outside while my drummer played, I could barely, and I mean barely hear the drums, which seem to be the main problem. However I am saving up for some curtains that should help a lot. Bass and guitar volume are kept at the bare minimum they need to be at to accommodate the drums. Mixing isn’t really a problem as far as the neighbor hearing it because I don’t need to mix at a high volume. I’m just trying to have a productive band practice without upsetting anybody. 

Thanks for reading, and sorry for the long post. I look forward to hearing what you guys have to say! ",t2_wyoqu,1,0
Hey! I need tips/feedback (no pun intended) on a session I got tomorrow regarding mic placement mostly.,"**The Instrument:**

One solo B^b clarinet (possibly also the same guy playing an E^b for other pieces)

**The Hardware:**

I have the following at my disposal: 

- Audix i5 (x1)
- Audix D6 (x1)
- Audix D2 (x2)
- Audix D4 (x1)
- Audix ADX51 (x2)
- Shure SM57 (x1)
- MXL V250 (x1)

**The Software** which I doubt matters:

Logic Pro X (yeah I know)

**The Room:**

Not many details on this. I'm given to understand it's made for medium-sized choral performances and acoustically 'treated' for such purposes. 

**The Purpose:**

It's for an audition tape, so it doesn't have to be stellar quality. I do want it to be good though, and I think it needs to be/want it to be achieved through good mic placement first and foremost.

**The Plan:**

- mic clarinetist with the MXL V250, since I think a large-diaphragm condenser mic is gonna get the best frequency range
- place MXL V250 about a foot away from the upper center of the instrument itself, because the player tends to move around when he's performing and because I'm given to understand that placing the mic upwards of center is going to deliver the best sound (other than that I only really know that mic'ing the bell is a bad call)
- Possibly place the ADX51s in XY at a height of about 6-6.5' behind the performer to capture the room ambience, depending on how the room sounds (this is my biggest point of uncertainty, I'm not sure if rear placement is good or if I should place them in the opposite end of the room or anything like that)

Anything you can tell me about what I'm doing right or wrong would be of massive help! I'm looking for any and all input on techniques of any relevant kind really, I'm new to this whole sort of thing.

Issues with live drums: drum and bass producer,"I make drum and bass which consists basically of drums, both synthesized and acoustic, and bass (synthetic, not acoustic).

My goal is to get decent at making breaks (using drum software like superior Drummer 3 to make pseudo recordings of real drumming) to use in songs. I don't need the acoustic drums to be as heavy as synthesized ones, I just need them to not disappear completely in the mix yet not be super synthetic. I can't overstate how loud my songs are. But I also don't want to be using dubstep snares at 170+ BPM. Drum breaks give some life to extremely mechanical music.

I'm decent at most other engineering stuff so thats not the issue. Overall, I can get satisfying mixes if using synthesized elements only for bass + drums.

 I have a hard time getting acoustic drums to sound good. 

Summary:

I have a hard time getting some loudness/harmonic content out of raw drums without obliterating the naturalness of the recording. I have no clue how other producers can make such excellently processed acoustic drums.

Issues with body/tail:

They're either too boomy with long tails if I enable bleed and use surround channels, or they are too fake sounding if I use volume envelopes. Release times for kicks/Tom's are super long by default, it's hard to get things snappy enough for high BPMs yet not fake 

Frequency spectrum issues:

The raw drum sounds are very quiet in a heavy song: little top end, low peaks, etc. So I will add some distortion ranging from tube to tape to waveshaping. But then everything just sounds harsh.

I'm using superior Drummer 3 which should give me enough technical choices to not have these issues so I think the real issue is just skill. I have more tools at my disposal than most famed engineers of the past. Basically anything that can be done with drums, I can do easily, except I am a drum noob.

Who here uses Izotope for mastering? What’s in your chain and in what order?,"Mastering isn’t my strong suit, but I can at least get my tracks sounding how I want them to sound finished and at a good level. 

For awhile, my chain went EQ, dynamics, exciter (minimal usage), stereo imager, then maximizer.

Annoying Gain Staging Question,"Hi All - 

Something's been stuck on my mind regarding gain staging. I fully understand the concepts of gain staging, headroom, analog domain, -18dbfs = 0VU, etc. We all know that it's important to give yourself plenty of headroom and have proper levels running into analog-modeled plugins... my question is, in the digital DAW realm, is it possible to have too low levels running into these plugins?

For instance, can you run your levels too low, say into an analog modeled channel strip, that the signal is no longer picks up the sonic influence, or ""analog sound"" of the plugin? Or are we fine just clip gaining everything down to get to a reasonable level (0VU) on the mix buss and call it good, when perhaps the high hat layer is sitting at -12VU, far below the ""ideal working conditions"" of the plugin?

History Question: why are old recordings so overdriven?,"I think this every year when I start listening to Christmas music, finally gonna ask someone. I’m not an pro audio engineer but I understand a bit.

Many old audio recordings (actually old, like 30s &amp; 40s; consider Bing Crosby’s early stuff) sound overdriven, but why is that? What were the OG audio engineers doing “wrong” and what improvements in recording equipment and techniques most corrected that problem?

I’m specifically wondering where the problem(s) were in the process. Were microphones just that bad and over-sensitive back then? Was it that the amps and preamps couldn’t handle any substantial signal? Did engineers not understand clipping? I’ve heard compression technology wasn’t utilized for a long time; was “loud parts clip” just the accepted trade-off for “gotta hear the quiet parts”? Was it a limitation of the tapes or vinyl being recorded to? Or is it some inherent issue in re-recording to newer formats (i.e. there was no distortion on the original record, but it showed up when they started transferring to CDs, etc)?

I'm largely playing synth and samplers. Asio4All is great but I imagine an interface might make for better playback quality?

If so, could I somehow make the iRig HD's input into an output? This way it receives what's going on in my DAW and shoots it back out to the studio headphones?  I have an older version without the headphone jack. Just a 1/4 in and connection to PC. 

Thanks!",t2_5i4zj,1,0
Question regarding mix bus compression,"Lately my process is to keep individual track below around -6 db, and I have been utilizing lots of busses. For example a drum bus with all of my drums and percussion, and a music bus with all musical tracks. Then a vocal bus as well. These all get sent to a mix bus, which I compress and then use make up gain to push the mix into a limiter. Even though my individual tracks + busses are down between -9 and -6, the mix bus adds up and peaks a lot closer to zero (before the compression+limiting I mean).

Does this mean I am not getting the full amount of headroom I could be taking advantage of? Should the mix bus ideally be peaking closer to the peaks of the individual tracks/busses, so I can get more out of the compression + limiting? Is this something I can achieve through better leveling, better EQ? My mixes have been a lot louder than in the past so I think I’m on the right track, but I’m not sure. 

If anyone has any advice or feedback that would be much appreciated. thanks",t2_cuwey,5,0
Help with mixing synth bass,"My mixes are sounding good, a sort of indie rock sound of Guitars, Bass, Piano, electronic drums and synths. 
My only issue is that I can't get my synth bass lines to pop/shine. I'm using a microbrute (monophonic) which I've recorded a few layers of (usually just octaving it)

I've tried everything from reverbs, delays, saturations, eq, comps, etc
The best solution I have ATM is to double it and pan it hard left and right but I'm not sure if that's the best route?

Any tips? Should I just be ok with the fact that sometimes instruments are ""felt"" more than heard in some mixes?

The Effects of Putting a Speaker in a Box,"I apologize it this post isn't relevant to this sub. Feel free to remove it if so.

So I live above a food place in a very old building and the manager recently installed speakers in the ceiling...directly under my bed. And they love to play music late at night. 

He claims to have built a box around the speaker in the ceiling that will insulate the noise, but as far as my understanding goes that'll just amplify the noise and as long as it's still attached to beams in a ceiling that isn't insulated it won't really effect the reverb that rattles my floors. Am I wrong? What would be a solution to this? Is it not having speakers in the ceiling? Or is there a viable way to deaden sound in one direction without losing too much in the opposite direction?

How do you guys apply reverb?,"Hey,
I’m fairly new to mixing and trying to figure out how to apply reverb to my mixes.
I make mostly hip hop and EDM.


The way I do it is:
Set up 3 or more send buses. One short, one medium and one long.

I use the same reverb plugin on all three, but adjust the length; predelay time; EQ curve and wideness to get different ”depths” on each bus.

The shorter ones have longer predelay, narrower wideness and more of the higher frequencies.

Than I send my tracks (drums, melody, whatever) to the appropriate buses, with appropriate send levels and put EQ/compression to the buses.


What do you think? Is this a good approach?
Should I change something/switch my approach entirely?

Anybody run two separate side chains for kick and snare?,"First off, I'm mixing for loudness. 

I'm currently making a dubstep track, where the main elements in focus are kick + snare, bass synths and my sub bass. 

Recently I've been finding it harder to get my single sidechain rack (sidechaining both kick and snare under the same curve), to effectively duck my synths enough so that the dynamic range is minimal.

What's happening is that when my kick hits, my sidechain ducks the synths fine and I'm at -10 with both playing, while then the snare hits the master peaks at -5.

Question is it common practice to use two separate sidechain curves, as in a short cut for the kick, and more gradual for the snare?

I'm looking for more of an answer than to just turn the snare down as that's obvious.

Note: Both kick and snare are soft clipped and peaking at -10.

Would I be able to distinguish between a noise happening outside vs inside? Would I even be able to pick up a noise coming from outside the room or house? Of course it depends on the structure of the room. I guess I might be able to filter out certain noises that the phone may pick up such as the phone vibrating due to a message, or maybe even snoring. 

I suppose I'm just curious if there are too many random variables to account for to do this casually rather than setting up the proper equipment to measure something like this accurately. Also, if there is a better sub to post this to, let me know.

Seeking Advice On Prepping For Home Drum Tracking,"Howdy fellow sound geeks, I come seeking advice on prepping for some drum recordings.

some background: I'm 19 still living with my parents and I've been putting together an amateur studio. Over new years my family are going abroad and I've opted to stay for a number of reasons, one of them being having the house to myself to work on music while I have time off work. Over this time period I'm hoping to get some drums recorded for commercial release for my own music.

&amp;#x200B;

The current plan is to move my drum kit into the family kitchen/living space (a large, very reflective and bright room. It's kinda rectangular with alot of uneven surfaces and angles) in the hopes to get quite a big but controlled room sound.

&amp;#x200B;

As it stands the kit configuration will be:

\-Pearl decade maple kit (only mid and low tom, fusion sizes)

\-Ludwig 402 Snare

\-Paiste 402 Hi hat and ride (using the ride to crash)

&amp;#x200B;

And mic config will be:

\-Shure dm112 kick (facing into the hole of the kick)

\-SM57 snare top &amp; bottom close mics

\-RVD9 dynamic mics on toms

\-RV4 Pencil condensor mics (spaced pair)

\-Neumann u87ai room mic, placed low to the ground to avoid cymbal noise

\-sm58 crush/energy mic

&amp;#x200B;

Overheads going into a art tps II pre tube preamp and the rest going into a behringer ultragain

&amp;#x200B;

I also have 4 ikea bookshelves stuffed with rockwool intended to treat my mixing space that I could use as baffles

&amp;#x200B;

I intend on moving stuff around to find sweet spots and what sounds best but I'm looking for advice that would help. Mainly surrounding the OH and room mic config

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts are I could use the u87ai as a mono overhead because I know from past experience that it tends to respond well to the paiste 2002 cymbals and get my stereo imaging from stereo room mics and toms. Alternatively, I do have a small bit of budget and could rent out a pair of coles 4038's as overheads and keep the 87 as a room mic.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: should I jump straight in and rent the coles or try the other two configs first? Where would people recommend placement of a mono overhead? where should I place baffles? currently my thinking is have the drummer face lengthways down the room (its kinda rectangular) with the baffles either side and behind and room mics on the other end of the room.

Hi everyone,

There are surrounding circumstances that I can address if need be but I'd like to get straight to the point! For clarity, I am still in the beginning of my journey as an amateur recording engineer, but I'm closer to intermediate than a novice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a sennheiser e906 that I close mic on my deluxe reverb, and it is miles better (to my ears) than the sm58 I was using previously.

"Song with only 5 audio tracks and no VSTs = lots of latency. Song with 15 VST-heavy, MIDI-effect heavy tracks? Near-zero latency. Why is this?","Hey all. Noob hobby producer here. Just got into it a few months ago, so pardon any incorrect lingo. I appreciate all the info I've gotten on this sub, but couldn't find a reasonable explanation for this one. Maybe one of you can help me out.

Right now I'm recreating Hans Zimmer's *Interstellar* \-- lots of orchestral sounds, many plug-ins, effects, the whole bit. There is very little latency from midi keyboard to Serum, other plugins -- I'd say it's responsive enough to play in real time without any issue. Song is about 2 min long.

The other song I'm working on, however, has crazy latency. It's an electronic dance song with lots of bass and synth -- it *was* a pretty dense with effects and so on, before I froze all tracks and converted to audio. Now there's only 5 audio tracks, yet the latency is still very high. (I should add that I've used Ozone 8 to master the track, but I don't see that as the issue because Interstellar is mastered just the same.) Song is about 2 min long.

I'm on felony probation and my studio head doesn't know. How will they react?,"Background: I work at the largest distributor of guitar lessons in North America, a company which I guess will remain unnamed in this post. I'm on felony probation for a bunch of drug related burglaries I did a few years back, to which I'm making active strides to clear up. I've been working at this studio for about 6 months and my probation officer has told me I'm legally obligated to tell my boss, but I'm so consumed by fear about it, like they'll fire me, that I don't know what to do. Recently the other studio assistant got fired due to negligence (lost 3 whole educational courses because he wasn't backing up drives) and so in the production department it's just my boss and me, and some random freelancers who work from home. Basically at this point they really actually need me. I know people value honesty and integrity, but I've just had such a hard time bringing myself to tell my boss about this stuff because during the interview process they never asked, so it never seemed pertinent. Part of me thinks they're not used to dealing with people like me, former convicts who have cleaned up their act and just want a fair shot at success, but the other part of me knows that no matter what happens, if they fired me for this then it just wasn't meant to be.

Why are echo and reverb so different to one another? Don’t they won’t the same way?,"In practise echo is a delayed repetition of the sound like when you should ‘hello’ at the mountains and hear it back a few times. Reverb is a long decay of a sound like water droplets in a cave where the sound lasts longer than the droplet and resonates all around. 

But in many real life instances, there is both echo AND reverb in a space like a cathedral for example. 

Don’t reverb and echo work by the sound reflecting off surfaces? What causes reverb as opposed to an echo and how are they technically different? ",t2_141p1u5k,52,0

"Do you think there are some things that are inherently wrong in music production, or can anything and everything be pulled off in the right context?","There are so many artists and albums that found their calling, niche, or created a legacy through some form of 'breaking the rules' - too many to list. Then again, I feel like there are some things which would be hard to make sound 'right', or otherwise sound like they were done intentionally or creatively.

I'm not thinking about definitive traits of genres like noise music here. As an example, one thing in particular that often crosses my mind is the presence of anything resembling a 'pop' or phase glitch out of place. Again, glitch music is entirely based around the use of 'glitchy', distorted, or otherwise 'accidental' type sounds. Again, some songs make a feature, or pastiche out of vinyl/tape crackle or hiss - this is an aesthetic choice and again, perfectly okay in my eyes. But I've heard a couple of otherwise well produced songs with the presence of an extremely transient high frequency 'pop' (much like you'd get if you forgot to fade out a region ending on a non-zero-crossing) and it seems far too obvious to have simply been a mistake. This is one thing that simply just sounds plain *wrong*, bad even, to my ears. Another one would be 'muddy' sounding frequency clashes of distinct sounds, but perhaps the jury's more out on that one.

What are you guys' thoughts on this?

*Side note: I have enjoyed plenty of things written/produced by Animal Collective, but Danse Manatee is just about the most offensive-sounding production I've ever heard committed to tape. The overwhelming reliance on/presence of extremely trebly harmonic content from the get-go was an affront to my ears. IMHO, there's a good reason people don't tend to that in music. It sounds terrible. YMMV.*

Converting recorded drums to MIDI,"Hey all, if there's a better place to ask this question, please let me know.

I have a drum recording that I am trying to convert to MIDI and then run through a VST (KVLT Drums). Reason being that I'm finally biting the bullet and doing my own drum arrangements for my band's EP, but I have one track that we got a real drum recording of, but I want the consistency of having the drums on each track sound the same. There's no way I'm skilled enough to replicate the recording into MIDI by hand, so I thought I would be able to just route the tracks (10 of them in the recording) into MIDI channels to receive sampling from the plug-in.

I'm using Ableton Live 9, which I know is not the ideal DAW for a lot of things, but it's what I'm familiar with and what I have. Ableton's biggest downside imo is that many things which seem relatively easy to do in other programs have a clunky or un-intuitive work-around in Live--maybe I'm just missing something.

Anyway, I'm not sure that I can do this (routing audio recordings into my VST) without something convoluted like slicing each recording/channel to a new MIDI track, tidying it up (there is of course some mic bleed), tweaking velocity etc etc etc., and then routing it to the VST. 

Just looking for some tips to streamline this process before I go ahead and sink a bunch of hours into it the hard way. Thanks!",t2_fz61s,0,0
"Need help with spectograms, is this mp3 a 256kbps or 128kbps?","[https://imgur.com/a/srl12oX](https://imgur.com/a/srl12oX)

But when looking at this mp3 file (where it says it's 320kbps, wrong from what I know, as it should be 20.5k Hz), we can see that the frequencies go up to 20k, which would indicate that it's 256kbps, however there's this weird 'cut' at 16k Hz.

How did you break into the audio engineering industry?,"Hey all,

I read through the FAQ and I didn't really see anything on the topic of entering an audio engineering and/or sound design career with an electrical engineering background or existing degree in a sort of relevant field, so I'm going to pitch a couple different questions here to anyone who has some insight. I did find a couple related old postings, but I figure it's worth asking the community again.

Basically, I am a hobbyist music producer and have been for a couple of years. My main work however is as an electrical engineer, designing circuits and working with them at a major tech company. Life as a techie is getting to me, and I find myself devoting more and more of my time and energy to music. Now, I have a degree in signal processing which strikes me as at least a bit relevant to the field; will that help me at all to get a job with a studio? The more people I talk to in the audio engineering and sound design world the more I get the feeling that it's something I want to learn more about on the career side, I just am not quite sure where to start. I'm not asking for links to job postings, I'm more asking how you initially got into the industry and where you came from before it; what was your process from when you realized you wanted to work in this field? If you don't have a degree related to audio engineering, what did you do to make yourself hire-able? One more that's a bit unrelated, do any of you work as sound designers for audio companies? I met somebody who does sound design for commercials, games, etc &amp; I'm curious what the day to day work life looks like for that kind of job.

Thanks in advance, I've really enjoyed lurking on this sub and I've learned a ton of great techniques here. Any advice you have is majorly appreciated.

Sax/flute player using small mixer on stage,"What's up nerds! I have recently started gigging with a pedalboard for my sax (octaver, envelope filter, compressor, delay, reverb). I go from a Shure wireless into the pedals and out through a DI into the house mixer. 

I also have a vocal/flute mic ( Senn e935) that I would like to run through the same pedals (especially for the compressor and reverb). The best idea I've come up with is using a small mixer with an effects loop to send both of my mics through the pedalboard and still have 2 seperate channels so the sound person can mix the channels independently.
A benefit would be the ability to EQ myself from stage in a club where there is no sound person or no competent one (a few of the clubs I play regularly) and maybe even use the onboard reverb instead of a pedal. It seems I would also no longer need a DI? Is this a viable setup or am I missing something?

Field Recording Troubles,"I've been working on a small game development project with some friends and I have been handling sound design for them. The project requires a lot of outside ambiance (birds, insects, traffic, etc.).

Compression - Volume Matching and Makeup Gain,"Hey guys!

So I've been mixing for a while now but one thing I'm still yet to fully understand is makeup gain after compression. I understand that its purpose is to add back volume through the compressor after gain reduction, but my question is this: 

Are you meant to be adding enough makeup gain to match the reduction in gain? I.e. if there is -6.4db gain reduction at a vocal's loudest point, am I adding around 6db of makeup gain? 

OR

Am I simply adding enough makeup gain to match the level of the original vocal before processing occurred. I ask because If I add as much makeup gain as is being reduced, the vocal comes out as a much louder product generally speaking.

If I added 3db makeup gain on a vocal with -6db vocal reduction at its peak, that is usually enough to match the volume of the track prior to compression.

Editing with Multiple Lavalier Mics?,"I wanted to thank you all in advance for your help. I am quite new to this all and have been scouring the internet trying to find a way to do this effectively, but have hit a bit of a brick wall as I can't find any definitive answers.

I am unsure as to how I can switch between the two lavaliers smoothly during conversation? I assume this must be possible since industry uses similar setups at times.

All the videos I find about lavaliers go over things like EQ or how to physically record (eg, how to set up an external recorder)... but I feel like I might not know the proper terms to search the actual editing process.

Any direction you can give me would be GREATLY appreciated.

"Low Frequency Spectrogram Techniques, Noise Reduction Techniques","I hear a low frequency **HUM** Where I live in West Baltimore City. It's louder at night, only in winter and comes and goes over long periods, like several hours. I have some theories, but this isn't about that. Anyway, in order to analyse, I have two 15"" bass amplifiers plugged in as microphones which work beautifully, one in the basement on the floor and one on the first floor of the house. I can view a real-time stereo spectrogram using Adobe Audition 1.5 recording at only 441 Hz. I picked this frequency because it's 1/100th the normal sample rate that I use AND I can see a beautiful high resolution spectrogram at 2048 bands appear live of only low frequency audio showing everything up to 220 Hz. It only looks good after about 5 minutes, as it needs to show some duration for the sake of sharpness.  I'm looking to further analyse this and improve the quality of the analysis. I also have some distant noises coming in in higher frequencies recorded at higher sampling rates that I wish to isolate using whatever Noise Reduction tools I can find. So far I have tried various combinations of applications and plugins including:

\-Built in Noise Reduction using Adobe Audition 1.5

\-Built in Noise Reduction using Adobe Audition 3

\-Built in Noise Reduction using Adobe Audition CC2015

\-Izotope RX 5

\-Izotope Ozone 8

\-SpectraLayers Pro 5 (One of the best)

\-Spear

\-ISSE

\-PRAAT

\-ARSS

\-Waves WNS

\-Waves X-Noise

\-Waves Z-Noise

Acon Restoration - Acon's De-hum is THE best live de-hum effect I have found. (up to 96 harmonics with live attenuation + odd only option)

Diamond Cut Forensics 10 - DCF's De-hum is THE best post-processing de-hum effect (up to 400 harmonics + odd only option)

Sound It! 8 Pro, which comes with the Sonnox Restoration Bundle

And even Celemony Melodyne 4 for selecting unwanted partials to remove which works surprisingly well.

**But today I had an idea** and I needed to post this and share because the best ideas seem to come from thinking outside of the box. What I did was this:

I used an old audio effect program called HOG v0.71b to load a .wav recording and convolve it. The trick is:

**1**\- Take the .wav sample with the quiet BG sound you wish to isolate and slow it way way down, to like 40x slower than the original. Be sure to re-sample and NOT time-stretch. Ugh.

**2**\- Load the 40x slower version into HOG. Convolve it using the following parameters:

\----INPUT: (Load your slowed down .wav sample here)

\----IMPULSE: (Load your slowed down .wav sample here) -yes the same file. we will self-convolve.

\----OUTPUT: (Name your new file whatever makes sense for you)

Turn on MOVING, BRIGHTEN and 32 BIT NORMALIZE -No scale impulse, no mix back input.

WINDOW: Blackman\_Harris

IMPULSE LENGTH: 0.25 (length is measured in seconds)

PROCESS it!

**3**\- Open your output .wav and re-sample it back to the original duration and viola!

It is a **new method of Noise Reduction.**

**Note1**: Best for use on very quiet sounds among background ""air"" sound.

**Note2**: Horrible for use on clarifying garbled speech or differentiating speech among other people (BTW, if anyone knows methods for how to do that, LET ME KNOW!) Best I've tried so far is manually selecting using adobe audition CC2015 and SpectraLayers.

**REQ1**: If anyone tries this method and discovers better settings along the way or interesting ideas, please share! That's what this post is for! 😃

**REQ2**: If anyone knows any other rare or interesting audio restoration or just any interesting effects similar to these please share that as well. I'm on the lookout for more methods. I know about Cedar Studio 7. I just cant afford it. I wish there was a trial version I could use 😉, but I can't find one, so that's another thing I'm looking for. I'm determined to improve this setup, and I'm happy to help anyone with ideas or wishing to make a similar setup.

Some questions about mastering from someone who's only focused on mixing,"I've always been under the impression that a good mix is all you need. All of my compression is done in the production stage so when it comes to mastering all I do it put it through a limiter... however many people I've talked to say that mastering is an important part and not to overlook it so I have some questions I can't find the answers to elsewhere:

1. If my dynamics are already smoothed out in the production phase, and my RMS is good, do I really need to do anything else other than running it though a limiter?


2. I'm trying mastering with a multiband compressor to smooth things out more, should there be gain reduction applied all the time or just for the loudest parts? The songs I make have very aggressive and over-compressed sections as well as quiet and very dynamic sections. If my compressors are engaging for the quiet sections how do I stop it from smashing the signal for the loud parts? Or do you use a very low ratio/high knee to counteract this?

Maintaining sample rate while shifting pitch?,"Hey friends, 

I'm a software guy, I know absolutely nothing about audio engineering really, and I have a quick question. I'm currently working on a little software project that uses multiple .wav files and strings them all together in to one large .wav.

The problem: The .wav files do not all have the same sample rate. I am working with 22050hz, 44100hz and 88200hz files. When these are combined in to one master file, I must assign a sample rate to it.

If I assign the master file a rate of 44100hz, the 22050hz portions are suddenly playing twice as fast and play an octave higher than intended.

So, how do I either change the sample rates of the files without affecting the pitch/duration of the file, or how do I change the pitch of the file while maintaining sample rate and duration?

Thanks so much friends, I hope to post the finished project when complete!


EDIT: Got it figured out based on aasteveo's response using Audacity, HOWEVER!!!!!! !!!!If you want to actually export the audio at the desired sample rate you must change the ""Project Rate (Hz): "" dropdown menu in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Simply resampling the file and exporting it does not change the rate! ",t2_ivqqi,0,0

Playing With A Click Track/Metronome,"Hey guys, I'm not on reddit too terribly much so I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in. If it is, please just point me to the correct one and I'll post over there. Anyhow, I'm the leader of a church worship band, and I want to start using a click track (no cues, just like a metronome). We have a problem, and it is this: our vocalists like to drag and our drummer likes to rush. It's a bad problem, and I know that it could be fixed quite simply if they would have a metronome in their ear, but that's proven to be more difficult than I thought. The drummer does have in-ears, nobody else does, but I can get that setup easily enough, we do have the equipment. I've tried to play a click through the drummer's in-ears only, and it works for a short amount of time (while the song isn't loud yet), but as soon as the song gets big and everyone's playing loudly, he loses the click in his headphones to other instruments and strays off badly. If I turn it up in the beginning so I know he can hear it when everyone else is playing, he says it's deafeningly loud. What are your suggestions for me so that the drummer would be able to clearly hear the click all the way through without deafening him in the beginning?

"Pre amp quest, UA question.","Hey there everyone,

Had a couple of questions here and would really appreciate any help.

I’ve got an Apollo twin MKII, SM7b, cloudlifter and an AKG414  XLS.

I’ve recently noticed if I’m compressing a quieter source such as a finger acoustic or a whispery/soft vocal with the SM7b I get a pretty dramatic noise floor sound. Very loud hissing. I can get away with softer sounds using one of the condensers, which I’m aware are better than dynamics for softer signals anyway. 

However, I started to crank the Apollo pres to see when noise floor starts to show up (-60db and up) and it starts when I get the Apollo gain about 35% up. Gets worst as it goes and at 60% it’s pretty loud and I’d say with compression and eq and a soft signal it’s going to be noticeable in a mix.

My questions are :

A. Are the Apollo pres known to be noisey?
B. Are the Apollo pres cheap or less then wanted pres.
C. Would I benefit much in way of clean head room and less noise at higher again levels with a 3rd party pre such as an ISA ONE or a WA73?

Question about how console (non-DAW) mix settings are recorded &amp; reproduced.,"When a multitrack recording is mixed on an analog console, do the engineers make notes about all the levels/pan/EQ/compression, etc. of each channel (all 24 or whatever) so that if the song or album is ever remixed, they can at least start with the original mix settings? 

Also, when a recording is remastered, do engineers ever start with the multi-track 2"" tape, re-creating the original mix settings somehow (for instance, if the answer to my first question is yes) in order to step back one stage of tape transfer from the stereo masters, reducing hiss by one generation?  That seems like the ideal process for high-fidelity AAD &amp; DAD remasters, although obviously a lot more work, and maybe not worth the trouble, since there is so little hiss added by tape machines of that quality level.

I’ve spent the last few months devouring anything I can find on the topic, as well as experimenting with building my own bass traps and acoustic panels and just trying to listen to every room I spend time in and wonder why each one has the character it does.

I work in a music shop which doubles as a 4-room tuition studio. The rooms were not designed for music - some of them sounded downright nasty, and after learning some stuff over the past few months I convinced my boss that we needed to do something. He built some broadband absorbers from rockwool, wrapped in this very arty music notation fabric, and we carpeted the 2 rooms that had tiled floors. It’s far from perfect but we’ve improved the sound of every room.

When I first mentioned solving this problem to my boss, he and his wife agreed but both separately said “Of course, we could stick egg boxes all over the walls, but that wouldn’t look very good...”

And students who have seen the new (very attractive panels) and remarked at the improvement of sound in the rooms have mentioned egg boxes, and how that’s “what you normally see” and isn’t it nice that my boss made these attractive panels.

I’ve done enough research to know that egg boxes aren’t even worth thinking about. 

My question is: Why are they the first thing that comes to people’s minds when they think about improving room acoustics, and why won’t the myth die?

Slanted Ceilings in Room ... Monitor positioning?,"I recently purchased a home (1960s build), and I am planning on converting one of the bedrooms upstairs into a small ""studio"" space, where I can listen to records and mix music. The house is 1.5 stories, and the rooms on the top floor all have slanted ceilings. I have attached a current image of the room. [https://imgur.com/HSGJR6C](https://imgur.com/HSGJR6C)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question would be ... what is the optimal set up/position for my monitors? I am assuming the slanted ceilings are going to have an impact on the sound from the monitors.

Cutting The Cord,"I don't know if this will resonate with many of you here but maybe for some it will. This is primarily aimed at those who do pro bono mix work for people in order to skill up in their journey.

I started with this whole thing back in the 90s, not seriously but enough for it to be a solid time to start making mistakes for long enough to learn from them. 

Over time I started putting myself out there as a ""free mix engineer"" for various bands and artists I'd meet online and invariably they were interesting but something of a challenge in the performance and recording department which always resulted in a lot of work to get even passable results.

This began to snowball into friendships and unpaid obligations. While I was never really in it for the money and I never wanted to do this as a career, the feeling that I needed to keep practicing to become better for my own music was a blinder to what I was allowing to happen.

I was mixing garage bands, random artists of various genres, and spending entire weekends just trying to unfuck the worst of disasters. I got pretty good at doing that considering the starting point but the price was a lot of time taken away from my own life sitting there trying to prove something to myself that doesn't even matter in my own scope. At some point you learn how to use the tools and then you are at risk of becoming stifled by the context in which you're using them if you limit yourself to it.

I say this to those of you who are no longer learning from that free work you're putting out there and find yourself repeatedly fixing easily avoidable mistakes and feeling trapped by an expectation you're no longer getting anything out of: 

Let it go. It's done. Wish them well and move on. They are holding you back from whatever you're trying to do. If your goal is to do this as a living, dive in that pool, don't keep trying to perfect your backstroke in a bathtub. Do what it is that you're keeping those people around to try and convince yourself you're capable of doing, the moment you have stopped learning from that experience.

EQ Gain makes drums dull? Weird problem!,"Hi.  
Straight to the point. I use GarageBand.  

&amp;nbsp;


  
Problem:  

EQed a drummer track with slight LP and HP filter and a few moves to bring up the kick.  
  
To match input and output levels I turned down the EQ gain so the max peaks and average peaks would hit almost exactly where they'd hit with the EQ off. 

&amp;nbsp;


  
  
When A/Bing EQ on vs off I noticed that despite the peaks being the same the track sounds dull / less powerful.. mostly because the snare felt supressed.  
  
Turned off each EQ point one after another but the dullness remained. Only after bringing the gain back to 0db the drums came back to life.  

&amp;nbsp;


  
Now, why is the EQ gain doing this? There are no plugins after the EQ. It's the last in the plugin chain. No automation, no busses etc.  
  
Is this some GB mystery bug (already discovered a few of those) or what is going on?

Stopping plosives and pops when recording. Have a pop filter and good mic placement,"Recently purchased a mic. Mojave ma201fet

So the mic is awesome.

But only issue is that when I start recording, the very first sound i make when recording the verse is always loud. It ""pops"".

For example if the first word of my verse is ""damn"" the ""d"" sound will pop. If the word is ""clock"" the ""cluh"" noise will be loud and pop.

 The rest of the verse is completely fine. It's just that first word.

Any idea what might be causing this issue?

I have a pop filter. And this was never an issue with my old microphone, an mxl v67g

I have the low roll off enabled and I don't stand too close to the mic either.

Yet no matter what, the first word of my verse always starts with a pop.

I always have to automate the fader to reduce the plosive sounds when mixing.

Strange sensation in left ear,"TL;DR: Strange muscle spasm feeling in my left ear, don't know what it is.

I take relatively good care of my ears, I follow all the standard routines and stuff to stop ear fatigue and damage but this has been bothering me slightly lately.
You know when you're incredibly tired or stressed and get random muscle spasms? I've been getting somethig very similar in my right ear. It's been happening for the last maybe three of months. 
For maybe the first month I wrote it off as stress and lack of sleep, but now that it's carried on and I'm in much better health, I'm worried.

It occurred to me that this could be some sort of damage to the ear. Given that it's not triggered by excessive noise I'm not sure this would be the case and I don't hear any tinnitus like sounds so I'm honestly not sure. Figured I would ask some prod that take great care of their ears.
Thank you

[QUESTION] Long post asking for help with band rehearsal setup,"Sorry for the long post, but I have a lot to ask. I’m looking for guidelines, tips, etc. while I start down the road of improving my band’s rehearsal sound.

We are a group of middle-aged friends who recently started getting together weekly to rehearse rock songs, mostly grunge. Most of us played in bands in the past but stopped due to kids/work. We’re all back into it and are looking to improve as musicians who might occasionally play out. But for now, it’s just for fun.

We share a 15’ x 20’ rehearsal space with other bands, [which looks like this](https://imgur.com/a/7KrpoNO).

I have amateur experience with home recording and have done live sound a few times, but I’m very green. I think I have OK ears and am a bit of an audiophile, and I usually pay attention to a mix even when casually listening to music.

Setup:

1.	Mixer – Allen &amp; Heath Qu-16
2.	Two wedge floor monitors. Forget the brand, but they’re 15” with horns and sound OK.
3.	Monitors are used for vocals, guitars (one direct from modeler, other mic’ed from small amp), and keys (direct stereo).
4.	Bass plays straight through large bass amp
5.	Drums are not mic’ed.

What works:

1.	The space is comfortable, with carpet and acoustic treatment on the walls. Ceilings are high, 10’ or so.
2.	Drum riser is good, gives us nice face-to-face visibility
3.	Awesome mixer, decent monitors
4.	We religiously record and review each rehearsal to hear what’s going on. I’ll post some samples after we get some obvious things dialed in – not worth listening to right now.
5.	Bandmates are cool, we’re all in this for fun, we’re all old, and so no ego stuff happening. I mention this because they’ll be more open to experimenting, vs. having a hotshot guitar player who needs to be max volume all the time.

What doesn’t work:

1.	Wish we could get rid of some of the furniture and spread out more, but it’s not our space
2.	We usually play way too loudly, and it’s one of those things where we start out loud and get super loud by the end. I took a measurement one day with a proper meter and we were close to 110dB room volume. And that wasn’t our loudest.
3.	I play guitar and usually can’t hear myself, even though I’m right in front of the monitor. This is apparent in our recordings too. In fact, over the two months that we’ve been together, we’ll cycle between bass too loud, drums too loud, keys too loud, etc.

Setup questions:

1.	Should we mic the kick drum? And if so, is a fancy drum mic necessary or can we use an old SM57/58 for now?
2.	Should we run the bass direct? And if so, do we need a DI box or can we plug straight into the board? Reasons for not doing this is fatiguing the monitors, and also the bass amp sounds cool and very full through the amp ;)
3.	Floor wedges are angled toward the center. Given our small space, should we aim these straight back so those of us who stand off-axis can hear more?
4.	Any tips for reducing room volume? And what is an ideal room volume anyway? Tough conversation to have as everyone wants to use the time to rock out and let off steam. But when we play so loudly it’s impossible to hear each other and everything is a mush of sound. Plus not at all good for our ears (we wear plugs, but still).

Mix building:

1.	What are the standard “do this every time”  or ""never do this"" things? E.g. don't turn yourself up without checking with others, because maybe the rest can turn down.
2.	From other replies, it sounds like I should start with the drums, then bring bass to similar volume, then guitars, then keys, finally vocals.
3.	Is it correct that when setting levels that everyone play at max patch volume, and then only dial back for quiet parts of a song? Right now I think the bass player backs off his volume knob (yes, I know it’s really a gain knob) for sound check and then ups it later on for “boost”, which is probably never dialed back. I suspect keys are doing the same. I set all my levels (clean, dirty) the same and then sound check with my normal dirty patch. I have a special boost patch a few dB higher just for leads. Other guitar player has clean patches quieter than dirty ones. What kind of ground rules should we have here?
4.	Right now I (stupidly) have everyone play/sing an E chord and try to quickly dial in levels in 20 seconds. I know this is wrong, but what’s better? Should we always start with the same song and have me adjust as we go through it? Or start layering on top of the E chord one-by-one?
5.	I currently pan my guitar a little more toward me and the other guitar more toward him, just so we hear a little more of ourselves. Is this normal/OK to do?
6.	Given our setup, is it safe to assume that everyone should be able to hear everyone somewhat clearly if we get room volume and mix set correctly? Or will it always be the case where the drummer can’t hear the keys, for example?
7.	How much should I be tweaking while we rehearse? I want to focus on the songs way more than the mix, so don’t want to be distracted/distracting by constantly fiddling. But I think it needs to be more than the total of 60 seconds that I’m giving it now.
8.	I’m assuming that if we work on getting our rehearsal mix dialed in better, then it becomes much easier for us to transition to a gig setup if we choose to play out. Is this fair?

Thanks. I know this is a lot, but any help is appreciated. I’ll post more specifically (and succinctly) as I start working through this.

Sound Canceling Speaker,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, please direct me if you think of somewhere better to ask this.  


I've had this idea in my head for probably 10 years. I want a speaker that can produce high quality sound but only to the intended recipient. For example, I am sitting at my desk at work and want to listen to music. I want to hear it, but I don't want to disrupt the rest of the office. I also don't want to wear headphones in case I need to hear something around me.

&amp;#x200B;

[This image](https://imgur.com/DvV2jNV) is my idea. A small speaker that has 2 speakers. Speaker 'A' is sending out the music you are listening to, and Speaker 'B' is sending out frequencies that are 180 degrees out of phase from the music that would somehow ""collide"" with music 'A' at a set disctance so that outside the radius the music is dead.

Room/SPL measurement help,"Hi all,

I am a HiFi enthusiast, and would appreciate your help. I have set up an alright near-field music setup with Genelec G3, Benchmark DAC2 HGC and plenty of acoustic treatment (Konto panels and DIY bass traps). However, I don't have a way to take objective measurements of sound levels and room response. I want to make sure I don't damage my ears with too loud music and want to also get objective data on my room's response.

I am located in Finland, so Thomann's selection is available for me. Budget target is around 100€, but I can stretch to 200€ if it is necessary 

I don't have any microphone or mic preamp. I need to get the signal from the mic to my PC, so and USB mic or mic/usb-preamp combo would be the way (I think).

I won't be using the microphone for other purposes than measurement. From what I know, I think the mic should have a flat response and an omnidirectional pattern.

1) Is there a microphone that would do both: reliable SPL and room response measurement? Or would it be better to purchase separate devices?

2) Depending on the answer to question 1, do you have recommendations for the devices? 


Thanks in advance!

"When do you pick plate vs hall, etc?","I'd think this would be a common topic but I just searched up plate on the subreddit and didn't see a bunch of posts about this topic.

I have been using Soundtoys Little Plate recently as a send with decay at minimum (500 Ms)lady anding Si Q to boost the send highs by 15 dB (Little Plate is extremely dark). Most sounds get 5-10% wet.

I'm pretty happy with what I'm getting with Little Plate. I'm also renting to own Toraverb but I have a hard time figuring out which would be best. The two are completely different (plate vs computational) but the difference isn't as apparent as the difference between any other effects I use (chorus, EQ, flanger, phaser, distortion, etc).

Are there situations in which you would instantly realize you need a hall instead of a chamber, plate instead of hall, etc? Or when you would decide you need multiple?

I like the sound of dry stuff and plates seem more forgiving because I can get low decay times (this I why I don't currently use chamber for example). Little plate is snappy enough on drums but I don't find myself wanting to use something less snappy on a vocal for example. Even on a pad which is AFAIK the most naturally reverby sound. Would you naturally increase the decay time you use for a pad or other non transient sound using a second send?

My Guitar Tracks Sound Like Garbage,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started getting into home recording mostly just to record my own ideas and try to get a decent mix in the end that I can show my buddies or put on youtube.  The issue is that everything I record kind of sounds like garbage.... Its just full of low end and lacks brightness and that chimey tone. The thing that bothers me the most is when I watch a Youtube clip of someone demoing the same amp / sim / IR's as me it sounds totally different and this is with no EQ or Compression etc... Even the DI tracks they record just sound better but I can only imagine this is a hardware issue on my end.

&amp;#x200B;

My equipment is a Steinberg UR22 for an interface and I use Studio One as my DAW. I either plug my guitar into my 6505 tube head which is plugged into my Two-Notes Torpedo live into channel 2 of the UR22 or I try and just go straight into the channel 2 with the instrument level button pushed on and use either Helix Native, Bias Amp, S-gear 2 etc with quality IR's ( Ownhammer or Celestion ). My guitar is a Ibanez JBM100 I think? Its the cheaper Jake Bowen signature guitar.

&amp;#x200B;

Is my UR22 not cutting it for this application? Am I overloading the pre? ( I do see some clipping and the gain is at the lowest ). Is there something I can do to fix that?  If I was to buy a different interface what would you recommend? I am really looking at doing almost anything at this point and I feel like I have good hardware maybe minus the UR22 since its low end",t2_f6ym47s,1,0

Load box for IR's question...,"Starting to jump in to the world of IR's...I'm scared. Always mic'd up amps but to more I read and see, I'm coming round to the convenience for sure. 

I bought a Bugera PS1 hoping to kill two bids with one stone, firstly to be able to use my amp at low volumes and secondly to use it as a load box and try this IR business. 

Well either my amp doesn't wanna play ball or the PS1 is not that great as an attenuator...it sounded TERRIBLE very fizzy, made me hate my amp (Cornell 20w Plexi). I tried using it as a load box but didn't really get anywhere, I think the attenuator was still getting in the way as the manual says when using the power soak you will instantly be hearing your amp at 50% so basically I was trying to get a signal into Logic in with an IR on half the sound/volume my amp should be pushing out. 

So now I'm looking at dedicated load boxes, maybe something like the Suhr Reactive Loadbox which I believe will just send the same amp signal through to my interface. But here is my question...

Since I have a Plexi style amp, theres no master volume so to get my overdrive I need to crank my amp (hence my attenuator experiment at the beginning)...so if I was to use a dedicated LB, where will I essentially be able to get my extra gain? Bringing Master faders in Logic down while turning the amp up? 

Apologies if this is such a straight forward thing, I've just done so much research and YouTube'ing I'm not really making any sense of it anymore.

Crosstalk in my patchbay is driving me crazy,"So I recently bought a Behringer patchbay, definitely not top of the line but I thought it would get the job done.

Thoughts on metalcore production?,"Other than a few albums by August Burns Red or Katatonia  (and they hardly fall under the ""core"" label), most albums in the genre don't *sound* spectacular. There's no depth, no substance, no *balls*, nothing that makes me foam over their studio gear. Older recordings, like ""Back In Black"" or the ""Cheers"" theme have something magical about them, you all know what I mean, and that should be easy to carry over to metal, but no one seems to be doing that.

I'm thinking years of low budgets and lo-fi recordings have done something to the culture just like what happened to punk and black metal way back when, but ""American Idiot"" by Green Day and ""Everyone, Everything, Everything Ends"" by Shining suggest even the most dedicated DIY scenes can value quality. And I'm just not hearing that from core bands.

My band just started pre-production on our second album.  Our producer's into all the big core acts and as I hear their records, as I watch him quantize/pitch adjust all the guitar and vocal parts and layer them with some digital misinterpretation of ADT, as I hear people go ""huh?"" at the word Neve, I fear we're not gonna be challenging ourselves to get something spectacular.",t2_wobc5,4,0

Obviously soundproofing and acoustic treatment are not the same thing, but I'm still curious to see if anyone has compared the two, especially for corner bass traps.

&amp;#x200B;

For those who have purchased commercial absorbers / bass traps, how are they constructed? I know most use fiberglass (gross) but it would interesting to see the differences between panels and how the construction affects performance.

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan for wall panels is to make a frame out of 1x4s, put a 2"" thick piece of mineral wool in there, and leave a 2"" air gap in the back. For corner traps, I thought of either A.) having a sheet of mineral wool in the front, and denim to fill in the space behind, or B.) getting both 24"" and 16"" wide panels and making a double-layer corner trap with an air gap in the middle.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT- I'm also curios if anyone has experience building / using diffsorbers? I've heard of putting a sheet of pegboard in front of an insulation panel to make a diffsorber. What about a pallet with rockwool shoved in there? It would be easy to mount- just set it on the floor and lean it against the wall.",t2_69zi9,5,0
"I'm an assistant engineer at a recording studio. Am I an employee, or an independent contractor?","I've been working at a studio in NYC for a little over a year, and my understanding is that I'm an independent contractor. However, now that I'm learning the difference between that and an employee I'm starting to think I'm misclassified.

While I do take sessions as an engineer every so often, the bulk of my hours are as an assistant. I have little control over these hours, and I'm basically on call 24/7. While I wasn't trained by the studio on anything engineering-related, all of my assistant-only duties had to be instructed to me, such as taking payment from a client. I don't have my own established business and I never signed any sort of contract. I never negotiated my rate; I just accepted the rate that they gave me. It really seems like I should be considered an employee.

I haven't had to pay taxes yet, but I know it's going to be a pretty big hit when the time comes as I'm not exactly making bank here.

This is my only experience working at a recording studio, so I don't have any knowledge of how other studios operate, in pretty much every sense. How do most other studios compensate their assistants, and how are they classified?",t2_6muii,122,0
Philosophy on multiple vocal tracks,"Hi, I am struggling to decide when I should leave vocals as a single track or when I should add additional vocal tracks- And if I do add multiple vocal tracks, should they mirror the main track, should they be an octave higher, or should they harmonize in another way?

I am aware that at the end of the day, the advice is always ""it's right if it sounds good"" but I was wondering if folks have personal opinions on how you approach this question, or if there are good online discussions on this topic.

I guess a related question is ""How many of the vocals that I hear on the radio that sound like a single track actually have additional sound incorporated from additional takes?""",t2_1r3g,8,0

Comparing Santana (1969) to Abbey Road and Pink Floyd work during that time.....,"I was listening to Santanas debut album and realized how GREAT it sounds for the time (By great I mean, well balanced, perfect clarity/detail on every instrument).

Recording line-level with a Berhinger UMC204HD ? (Silent Brass),"Let me preface this with an apology for my very amateurish questions!

I currently have a Berhinger UMC204HD audio interface, which has 2 XLR/TS combo inputs. When connecting a microphone via XLR, the ""Line / Inst"" toggle switch doesn't apply, but if I connect via 1/4"" TR it does apply.

&gt;**From the manual:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**LINE / INST** (UMC202HD / UMC204HD / UMC404HD) selector designates line level or instrument level input source at combination XLR / ¼"" connector(s).

Now, my confusion comes from the labelling of this switch: ""Line / Inst"", which I thought was Line-level and Instrument-level, but now I think it is referring to something else OR my understanding that headphone output was line level is not correct!

If I connect a TRS lead from the headphone output of my Silent Brass system to to the TS input of a combo, the levels are extremely low while set to ""Line"", and are higher when set to ""Inst"", but still too low to be useful. Poor signal to noise. (Pad switch not pressed).

*(FYI Silent Brass is a trumpet mute with built in pic up microphone, and a little box which remodels the sound so that my trumpet sounds real and loud through my headphones, but neighbours can't hear me).*

Connecting the microphone from the mute directly to the interface results in no sound. It needs the little magic box to be able to hear anything at all.

So, some questions:

1. Is a headphone output considered to be Line-Level?
2. Is the ""Line / Instr"" switch meaning ""Microphone / Instrument (guitar)"", and not actually meant for Line-Level?
3. The headphone output is stereo. Is it bad to connect it to a single input, even though there is only one microphone in the mute?
4. Is there any other way I can use what I have to record from the Silent Brass?
5. Am I just way off the mark here?

Thanks!",t2_kakix,0,0
Quick question about recording in stereo vs. mono,"Forgive my noob question, I am pretty new to this game. So I have a couple of synthesizers that I want to record as stereo  (to capture panning effects, etc.) using a scarlett 2i2 and ableton. I bought a couple of these [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SMMMH4/ref=oh\_aui\_detailpage\_o04\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SMMMH4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

thinking it was what I needed, but now I think I was wrong. I plugged the two ends into the left and right output of my synth and the single end into one of the front inputs on the 2i2, but sound was super quiet. Do I actually need to use two separate standard 1/4 inch cables, and use both inputs on the 2i2 in order to record one instrument in stereo? If that's the case, is there any way for me to record multiple instruments at once in stereo, without buying a better interface?

Advice with using a mic in a small room with terrible acoustics...,"Ok so, I'm a broke college student who can't afford $100 of acoustic treatment, plus my room doesn't really work space wise...

Anyways, my biggest problem right now is recording, my small room has terrible acoustics. When recording vocals I try to use my closet, it's not a walk in but it has clothes in it so I try to use them as a sound absorber. So my basic question is should I set it up so that I'm in between my clothes and mic or should I set it up so that the mic is between me and my clothes? I'm using a mic with a cardioid pattern, so would it be better to sing towards the clothes as a sound absorber, leaving the mic to pick up my room acoustic, or should I put them behind me so that the mic blocks the room acoustics and the clothes prevent any reflection back to the mic?

I think that the best would be to sing at the sound absorber, so that the most of the sound is killed right there. But it seems more logical to use the cardioid pattern (which I know doesn't work perfectly) to block the room acoustics and the sound absorber to prevent reflections coming back. So honestly I don't know, I'm not an expert and that's why I'm asking!

EDM Background,"So I've spent the better part of the last 8 years creating electronic music tracks start to finish. From sound design to final masters. However, having a musical background and instrument proficiency, amongst other reasons is why I'm starting to dip deeper into actual production and audio recording aside from fully synthetic projects. 

So my question is how much, if any knowledge I have about mixing and mastering electronic tracks can/should be brought over into the analogue world. 

I'm not ignorant to the fact that edm tracks inherently want to be crushed harder i.e -3 RMS whereas conventional tracks are more transparent. I'm more interested in the sound processing aspect. I.e learning if knowing that many instruments root freqs sit around 500hz, or that 4khz is the freq most senstitive to ears according to the fletcher munson curve, or using a 4:1 ratio for vocal compression, or to mono sub freqs; holds any value in audio recordings or to leave them at the door. 

Ive been watching URM academy, SpectreSoundStudios, and a little RecordingRevolution to also aid in this transition. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.",t2_x0mr05j,4,0

The film Bohemian Rhapsody has quite a bit of vintage gear on close ups.,"I just came out from watching [Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27zlBpzdOZg) and when in the opening sequence they highlight the [Shure 565SD](https://imgur.com/fKFxA6L) Freddie sang with during Live Aid, I knew the geeky tech aspect of things was going to be well covered.

And so it was. Of course the movie never really stops to delve into the recording too much, but it has enough of it. A great little montage showing the recording of their first album, and some longer sequences recounting the recording of Bohemian Rhapsody. In both of these (and in some other parts of the movie scattered around), there is plenty of quick close-ups to tape machines and analog consoles.

There is also a nice sequence where Queen is rehearsing for the Live Aid concert, shot at the real [Air Studios \( Lyndhurst Hall\)](http://www.airstudios.com/the-studios/lyndhurst-hall/).

Custom foam for mic rack drawer?,"I'm in Pick 'n Pluck hell for the moment with a new remote recording setup.  I'm trying to make everything as compact as possible, and I have a lot of mics I'd like to stuff in a 2U rack drawer.

Here's what it looks like currently:

https://imgur.com/a/22lRlSX

Unfortunately, standard pick 'n pluck foam ends up wasting a ton of space, I'm discovering.  Almost all of my mics end up wasting an extra row of foam in order to sit snug enough to not move.  

I think I'm going to have some custom foam made to perfectly fit everything.  Beside being able to specify the exact dimensions of the cutouts, I also would like to break up the drawer into two stacking trays, and put my more commonly used equipment on top, and less common on bottom.  Haven't figured out how to arrange all the mic clips and windscreens yet, though, so any suggestions are appreciated!

Does anyone have recommendations on where to have custom foam made?  I've never had to do this before, so I'm not sure where to start or how much it costs.  Do I need to provide a CAD drawing of everything to cut?  Is there somewhere I can download the detailed dimensions of common mics, or should I just trace the foam from the original mic cases?  

Is there a variety of foam material that is best for this application?  I notice that some high end mics come quite overprotected with a big case full of soft, very squishy foam, whereas some other high end mics come in compact cases with very dense foam.  I'm inclined to go with the denser foam, so that I can be more space efficient, but I want to make sure I understand the tradeoffs.  I also know I've had issues in the past with certain types of foam inserts disintegrating over time and getting foam dust everywhere.  I'd like to avoid that, so I hope it's the case that today's materials simply hold up better.

Creating a line driver for DJ equipment.,"So this is a little off the beaten path, but I'm trying to figure out the right way to handle this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple of DJ gigs coming up. Rather than use house systems (too much left to chance), I've been using an \[AKAI AMX Serato controller\]([https://serato.com/dj/hardware/akai-amx](https://serato.com/dj/hardware/akai-amx)) hooked directly to my laptop via USB (so the MBP/software handles all actual audio duties and then sends the composite signal back out of the interface). 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, as it's USB powered (no ability to use external power), the -10db RCA outputs are very weak and require gaining things way up on the house DJ mixer (or redlining the crap out of the interface itself - both are bad, obviously). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I need to create or modify an active line driver to goose the output levels of this contraption. One thing I was considering was grabbing a car audio line booster like \[this Cerwin Vega\]([https://www.amazon.com/CERWIN-IOEMHL-2-Channel-Output-Converter/dp/B00P25VU84/ref=sr\_1\_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541169732&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=audio+line+driver](https://www.amazon.com/CERWIN-IOEMHL-2-Channel-Output-Converter/dp/B00P25VU84/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541169732&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=audio+line+driver)) that would let me introduce an active gain stage to get maybe 6-10db more before it hits the house mixer line in. But this is a car audio product and has that 4-pin harness with one of the pins for a 12v power source. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just buy the thing, cut the red wire and run to a wall-wart? Can I even do that? I know my fair share about DIY builds in the studio, but car audio is an alien world to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Failing that, can anyone think of another solution without too much time or investment. TL;DR: Need to get 10db more gain from an RCA output. Thoughts?",t2_13vi5c,3,0

EQing my monitors to solve room problems?,"*Posted this over at the Reaper Blog forum on FB but just wanted to post it again here to get everyone's advice.*

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been trying to set up my room properly acoustic wise and I've moved my desk like 3 times over the past week trying to work out the best solution for my spot. I found a good spot but my room is an odd shape so it's obviously not perfect (is it ever though?).

 So, I did this thing where you set up a microphone at your listening point (where my head is in the equilateral triangle) and recorded pink noise to get a readout of where your room is at sonically. I analyzed the recording of the pink noise using Voxengo's SPAN. *(The mic was a sterling st55, obviously I know the mic should be 100% omni but I'm just working with what I have to try and improve my situation somewhat)*

 I then used three instances of an EQ to really match my room's recording of the pink noise to the regular pink noise generated by a Pink Noise plugin.

I also set the automatic gain compensation on the EQ's to make sure there was no increase in volume level from the  EQ's. I triple checked this using a test tone and there is no volume change with and without the EQ's.

The result seems to be awesome.  I saved these three EQ's as an FX chain called 'Room Compensation' and it really seems to help. Things sound a little bit ""better"" now. I also listened to some reference songs I have and they sound great so I'm thinking that this is a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

However..

I googled this and found an article saying that this was not a good thing to do; I don't understand why though. The EQ is compensating for the inadequacies in the room right? The general consensus from I've read on other forum posts and articles is that doing this can help solve frequency issues within a room but not problems that are 'time-based' like standing waves. I've seen so many responses on similar threads like ""yea, don't do that"" and ""that's dumb hahah"" without giving much reason but it seems to make sense to me.

Obviously this isn't a perfect solution and I am currently figuring out an acoustic treatment solution but to me it seems like, okay, the room is causing for example, a dip/rise at this frequency, so lets boost/cut it there to make it sound as it actually should. Makes sense..right????

Has anyone ever done this? Am I an idiot? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

*It's also important to note that this is only for monitoring purposes. If I did a mix I would then bounce the track down without the room compensation FX chain.*",t2_yo3fguf,1,0
Kick pedal squeaks are making me feel homicidal. HELP!,"I'm stuck in a weird situation and I need some guidance, if possible. 

I'm recording drums.  Three mics.  Three *mono* mics, that are running into a 4-channel mixer that outputs one *mono* line, and that line runs into a computer, recorded into a DAW. One mic on the kick, one mic on the snare, one room mic.  The fourth line-in isn't being used.


    in
    --&gt;| 1 | kick
    --&gt;| 2 | snare
    --&gt;| 3 | room
    --&gt;| 4 |null ---&gt;out---&gt;computer


The drum room is trash.  Sounds awful. Very low ceiling, and an irregularly shaped room with reflections coming from irregular angles.  The room is not treated, but can be pseudo-treated with blankets, comforters, sweaters, mattresses, etc.  I have some thick pads that could, in theory, be used as rudimentary bass traps, *maybe.*

Mics are all cheap sm57 clones.  Two are very close to the sm57, but one is a touch brighter (which I use on the snare).

But mics and room are not the problem. The main problem is the god damned squeaky springs from my pedals.  I have two pedals, and they both squeak. Oiling them didn't do anything.  Swapping springs didn't seem to make a difference. I don't have any sort of hardware or real-time non-latent software that can do gating, so I have no way to get rid of the squeak aside from EQ. At least *none that I know of.* That's where you folks come in...

WHAT THE HELL CAN I DO?!

EDIT: It's like this Led Zeppelin song.  Hear the squeaks?

Audio/guitar pedalboard power question,"Well I probably know the answer to this but I'll ask anyway...I've got a little Bluetooth receiver, like the kind people use to plug into the aux jack of their car and stream music off their phone. It has a teeny battery inside, and charges via microUSB.

(I realize there are lots of other ways to do this, but it's a very specific situation in which it would be easiest to do it this way if I can. Humour me.)

I assume the BT receiver wants 5V, as it's usually powered off a regular USB wall adapter...if I plug 9V into it, is this thing gonna heat up and be a problem, or is there a chance there's some kind of teensy weensy voltage regulator in there?

how to enable asio in matlab,"not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in, but

Im using Fireface UC audio interface.

    deviceReader = audioDeviceReader('Driver', 'ASIO', 'Device', 'ASIO Fireface USB', 'SamplesPerFrame', 1024, 'SampleRate', 48000);
    deviceWriter = audioDeviceWriter('Driver', 'ASIO', 'Device', 'ASIO Fireface USB', 'SampleRate', 48000, 'BufferSize', 128);

when I enable ASIO driver for both speaker and mic, for eg in the above code, there is no output sound. The buffer size settings obtained from  asiosettings(deviceWriter.Device) is set to 128 as well.

However when ASIO driver is not enabled, for eg in the following  code, there is real time output sound, but there is noticeable latency and a slight echo.

    setpref('dsp', 'portaudioHostApi', 3);
    deviceReader = audioDeviceReader('Device', 'Analog (1+2) (RME Fireface UC)', 'SamplesPerFrame', 1024, 'SampleRate', 48000);
    deviceWriter = audioDeviceWriter('Device', 'Analog (3+4) (RME Fireface UC)', 'SampleRate', 48000, 'BufferSize', 128);

Messed around and tried the following code, so it happens that if i set the mic to enable asio and speaker to enable WASAPI, latency is significantly reduced, but an echo still exists, after around 180ms from the original signal.

&amp;#x200B;

    setpref('dsp', 'portaudioHostApi', 3);

How do I successfully enable ASIO in order to reduce real time audio latency and have no echo effects???

"Using guitar pedals, interface line/instrument impedance matching.","I work with sound as a video editor, but I enjoy recording guitar as a hobby. Let me lay out a simplified version of my setup first:

* Guitar into Fender Level Set Buffer (1Mohm in, 1Kohm out) -&gt; last pedal on board is an MXR Reverb with an output impedance of 100ohm, a pedal I have on almost full time.
* Interface is a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 2nd gen (no clipping issue on the inst input like gen one), 1Mohm on the instrument, 52kohm on line

The line mode sounds a touch more articulate with less bass with the instrument being the opposite; I don't dislike either setting and I suppose this is a ""use your ears"" situation but I'm curious on this sub's take on the matter. If signal level isn't a concern with either setting, should I have my interface in line mode or instrument mode if I have all this active buffering going on?

This sort of piggybacks the ""should I use instrument in on my interface or a DI?"" and I keep reading ""just use your interface, the difference is negligible unless you love the color of a certain DI"" so I assume omitting a DI box is a sane choice. And yeah, I'm aware of the benefits (transformer isolation, interface using a shunting resistor, etc etc etc).

Edit: and before we get too far down the rabbit hole, I'm less interested in more exotic stuff like Eleven Rack's ""True Z.""

Since I'm looking at an entry level XLR mic and interface, supposedly this is not supposed to be an issue with the dedicated drivers.  But I was wondering about a certain scenario: using DAW/software for live effects and simultaneously playing sound from programs (a Youtube video for example).

Is it still possible to do these things simultaneously with low enough latency to not be noticeable?  Is it possible to do this without an interface as well?

The irony here is that Australia is (historically) notorious for its troublesome internet connectivity to the rest of the world, making every saved bit that more important.

Mixing drums difficulty from two types of preamps - transient speed mismatch?,"This November I am recording an Alt-Rock EP for my band, including acoustic drums. I have a decent room and some nice mics, but I will be upgrading eight preamps for this project.

Since the API 3124V came out, the 3124+ has come down in price to about $500 / channel used; I'll pick up on of these, and I'm also curious about the Manley Force which is a little less than $500 / channel used. 

My question to you guys and gals is, will having four channels of API and four channels of Manley create problems in the mixing stage if each preamp box has differences in ""speed""? What exactly is meant when they say that API is ""fast""? Is it your opinion that recording drums goes better when you have eight channels of uniform preamps, or is the difference in preamp properties an advantage? How do you think about this?

Reverb philosophies?,"Semi-amateur here, I’m trying to get some insight on reverb.

EQ matching and referencing at mastering stage,"I am currently pondering on the question 'where to apply the EQ matching technique (e.g. via Ozone 8 EQ matching; FF Pro Q2; MFreeformEqualizer) and using the classic reference technique to compare it to my own sound, while one is at the mastering stage?' Having said this, my aim is to reference the 'full' part of my song to a 'full' part of a reference mix.

My thoughts are that if you want to make use of EQ matching that it should be done AFTER the final limiter. On the one hand so, considering the fact that the compressor(s) and the limiter on my master chain can change the spectrum. Doing EQ matching or referencing a mix before the master compressor and master limiter could thus be a comparison between a reference mix and my own mix, which would not even be the final sound provided that the compressor and/or limiter would affect the spectrum. That would be comparing apples to oranges. A comparison AFTER the final limiter not.

On the other hand, finding out that my mix is too far off from the reference mix after applying one or both of these techniques AFTER the final limiter, could possibly make things rather complicated. For example, my EQ matcher could say that I lack between 800hz-1k. Where in the master chain should one fix this if one desires to follow the EQ matcher's 'advice'? If there is an EQ before the master compressor and you notch up 800hz-1k, it could lead to different reactions on the master compressor and limiter, and that would lead to having to set up one or both of those applications again. It is surely not the most practical way, but perhaps still a way which is worth to recommend?

And to go a little further into this subject, let's take it into the mixing stage: How should one apply the EQ matching technique and using the classic reference technique to compare for example a solo lead to my own solo lead, when we talking about processing in the LEAD bus, while still having an empty master chain?

Need guidance for a sound installation,"Hi, 

first of all I should say that I nearly don't know anything about sound engineering but I'm an electronic music hobbyist really interested in these stuff.

Summing and gain staging multiple tracks in live setting,"Sound men, 

I am a producer/dj and I'm curious how I should be approaching gain staging with up to six tracks playing simultaneously during my live sets.

I break my songs down into their components including k,s,hh,bass,melody1,melody2 so that I can manipulate each track live and not just be pressing play and fading.

My first approach was to keep the mastering plugins intact when bouncing each track down which left me with hot, tinny mixes. Since then, I have not been mastering each group of stems and have been trying to recreate the mastering process live with multiband compressor, limiter etc. on my master in Ableton when performing.

I'm curious to hear if you all think this is a decent approach to get a quality live mix without sacrificing the live manipulation component or if I should be leaving most of the compression etc up to the sound man.

And ideally, how much headroom should I be leaving on my master in Ableton for the soundman to work with?

Quickest way to re-encode a lot of files from FLAC to another codec? Can a GPU be used?,"Hi,

Since I was a kid I've had an obsession with ripping CD's that my father had lying around and finding the highest quality audio I possibly could to keep. Over the years I've collected all kinds of music around 500GB in total now. Wanted to put music on a pendrive for the car but I couldn't since you know, FLAC and basic consumer electronics dont get along very well... Retrospect, probably not the best idea to keep it all in FLAC but too late now lmao...

So here's my question! Each file can be encoded with a single thread, yes? So with a R7 1700X I should be able to run 16 threads making this go pretty quick. But I thought of something, 16 threads is great and all but what if a GPU could be used, then those 16 cores would be turned into 4,096 cores with a Vega 64. I get that GPU cores are smaller less powerful cores compared to CPU intended to do smaller calculations, but how big is encoding as a job? Is there any software solution for this? 

At this point I'm just messing around, I'm off school for the week and thought I would peer into the mind of reddit and see what everyone thought and if I was crazy or not. I tried googling but I just end up with a lot of nonsense related to OBS and whatnot. 

On a more serious note, what codec should I use? Correct me if I am wrong; the king of quality audio seems to be WAV, the king of lossless compression seems to be FLAC, the king of efficiency at the sacrifice of compatibility seem to be Opus in OGG. But from sweet spot between compatibilty, quality and efficiency seems to be AAC. So do I encode everything using AAC? What software would you guys recommend for a big batch job such as this? On my honda it says ""Only AAC files recorded with iTunes are playable by this device"" can I spoof that?

**^tldr;** -Is GPU accelerated encoding a thing for audio?
                 -Is AAC the best ""All-arounder"" codec. 
                 -What does ""Only AAC files recorded with iTunes are playable by this device""

"If a four string bass guitar's low E frequency is ~41Hz, isn't HPFing bass guitars at 40Hz a good idea?","This question is inspired by a Thumpinator pedal I've discovered recently: [http://sfxsound.com/microthumpinator/](http://sfxsound.com/microthumpinator/)

I've checked some other reviews and mostly they highlight how the low B (\~31Hz) sounds less muddy. The thumpinator is just a HPF with a cutoff frequency around 29Hz as I understood.

When playing bass fingerstyle there's additional low frequency content that gets through to the speakers from the fingers hitting the string, and it may muddy up the harmonic content in the lowest range.

So I've been thinking, if you play a standard bass, wouldn't you get this benefit from cutting off everything below the low E frequency? There's no harmonic content we lose, but there's always a possibility of some noise being down there, especially when playing live.",t2_gfr6z,10,0

Advice on Sound Ordinance Issues,"Hello all,

I play in a rock band in my backyard. We play in an old elevated trailer that has plywood walls and a couple windows. One of the windows has an ac unit in it so that the jam room does not get too hot. We set up a little area in the room to record rough demos and put up some light sound treatment that mostly just deals with high frequency diffusion. A couple bass traps were also put up in the corners to help with low end. I should say now that the room is in no way treated perfectly but I do not plan on making it perfect because I am only renting the house and don't want to drop too much money into the room. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the issue. My next door neighbor is unfortunately an elderly woman who doesn't take kindly to rock music. Or any other music it seems. She has told me when we first moved in that we were too loud. So we turned down our volume. This happened again and we turned down even more. I even made a compromise with her that we would only jam once a week for two hours..which sucks for an active band that needs this for practice. Well today she told me that she is removing the ceiling tiles in her house and wants me to put them up in the jam room. Now I understand that they probably won't do much of anything and she is really just giving me her trash. I reluctantly agreed thinking this may cause a placebo effect for her and she will think that it is quieter than before. Anyways, she said that she was going to call the police if it continues to be too loud. I looked up sound ordinance laws and it looks like the dB limit from my property line must be below 65 which is ridiculous because a lawnmower is louder than that. I think that I maybe fucked here. If police come, it will most definitely be louder than 65dB. Even if we turn down or aren't playing I think it will still be ""too loud."" Do I have any options here? The spl meter on my phone that I downloaded reads at 70dB with just me talking.

Looking for a specific term for a sonic phenomenon,"As the title suggests, I cannot provide a sound example because I am not sure what to call the phenomenon I am imagining, but I will try and describe it as best I can.  What I am thinking of is an effect that is essentially a harmonic instrument / sound with a beating effect, as if the continuous tone were broken up into smooth but distinctly beating ""purring"" oscillations.  I am probably not thinking of phase beating because the sound stays very harmonic, I think what I am imaging is closer to a form of resonance but on a much slower timescale.  If anyone could identify the name or give an example of this kind of harmonic purring / beating / fast tremolo-ish sound effect I would greatly appreciate it!

edit: the best example I can find right now is from ""love to you"" by the Beatles linked below.  At the 58 second mark, a low sitar/drone-like sound enters panned mildly right. You can kind of make out the individual peaks of this ""growling"" sound, and I think the way the low fundamental causes the higher freqs to noticeably ""purr"" with it is the effect I am thinking of.

Plugins that do something different or special,"Searching online, you can find thousands of different recreations of compressors, EQs, reverbs, etc.  Some of them are modeled after hardware, some of them are combinations of basic effects, some have crazy modulation of parameters.  But they all boil down to the same essentials.

I'm looking for recommendations for plugins that have a unique function.  They solve a specific problem or create a novel effect.  Perhaps they've been copied since their original creation, but the idea is still special.

Here's a small list of stuff that I've found, although I really want to hear from others.

[Nugen Monofilter](https://nugenaudio.com/monofilter/)
This collapses whatever is below a set frequency to mono, but instead of cutting the side channel (like with a mid/side EQ) it attempts to match the phase between the left and right channels so that no information is lost.

[Melda MSpectralDynamics](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MSpectralDynamics)
I've only heard of spectral processing recently, but it seems to be a game changer.  Imagine a multiband compressor with thousands of bands.  This plugin seems to be preceded by the ProAudioDSP DSM in 2009, which was itself preceded by the Voxengo Soniformer in like 2003.  This Melda one seems to be the most configurable and have the most features, such as sidechaining, which allows it to perform the same function of another special plugin, [Wavesfactory's Trackspacer](https://www.wavesfactory.com/trackspacer/)
This allows you to duck only the shared frequencies between two tracks.
Spectral processing kinda leads down a rabbit hole, with something like [Unfiltered Audio's SpecOps](https://www.unfilteredaudio.com/collections/plug-ins/products/specops) at the bottom.  I have no idea what it's doing or why, but it creates sounds I've never heard before.

[Pretty much anything from Sound Radix](https://www.soundradix.com/)
These developers seem to be on another level.  Auto Align finds the most phase coherent delay between two tracks.  Drum Leveler is like a smart compander that can also be sidechained to use the transients of one track as an envelope for another. Pi is really special, it adjusts the phase of multiple tracks in real time to achieve the most coherent output signal possible.  Powair is a level-independent (!) compressor that can use K weighting.  Surfer EQ is an EQ where the bands are shifted in real time based on the pitch of a monophonic input.

[Oeksound Soothe](https://oeksound.com/plugins/soothe/)
This is another spectral processor, but it seems specially designed for a specific task.  It is designed to dynamically remove mid/high resonances without affecting the fundamental tones.  It's basically the ultimate deesser.  I've heard it take the strain out of a vocal, the buzz out of a synth, the ringing out of a guitar amp, the string noise out of a bass.

[TBProAudio ISOL8](https://tb-software.com/TBProAudio/ISOL8.html)
It's a free monitoring plugin with 5 adjustable band pass filters with solo and mute, and a mid/side section.  At first I didn't understand why it was necessary, and now I can't mix without it.

It's a free delay that uses granular synthesis.  You can read up on granular synthesis if you're unfamiliar, but suffice to say that is a completely unique delay that creates soundscapes out of nothing.

There are other unique ideas out there.  Steinberg has a multiband transient designer built in to Cubase.  Acon Digital has a chorus effect with a phase randomizer so that there's no comb filtering.  Variety of Sound has a transient-aware saturator that allows transients to come through cleanly.  Waves MaxxBass is a great example of a plugin with a special function, although it is so old that there are many other bass resynthesis plugins available now.

I'd love to keep adding to this list!  Please share anything you think might fit.

What is a good RMS and Max. Crest Factor in Electronic Music (House/Techno) ?," Hello !    

&amp;#x200B;

I know what a Max Crest Factor and RMS is, but I do not know what a good value for the music I make is.  I mainly produce (not mainstream) house music at 110-120 bpm and have this plug-in called ""span"" which shows me these two values.  I think the values ​​are influenced by genre &amp; quality of production.  But what is a desirable value for house music with a lot of organic / dynamic sound material (real drums, sax, xylophone, funky bass guitar, percussions)?  How high should the value be in a more synthetic housemusic track?  My productions usually reach values ​​of RMS 14 - 17 and MaxCrest 8-10.  

&amp;#x200B;

How is the RMS and MCF in Major Productions?

And I realize that good values ​​are not synonymous with good music.

Sending from DAW through guitar pedals?,"Hi all...

I'm wondering about using my guitar pedals as FX from my DAW. I have a couple of spare slots in a 500 series rack, so am looking at the Radial EXTC 500 - However, quite a few of my guitar pedals are stereo, certainly the last few in the chain...

I assume the radial (or any re-amp box) is just changing signal on the way out from line level to instrument level / changing impedance to match what an amp or pedals are expecting?  

So if I want to get stereo back in, I could just use the HI-Z inputs on my apollo to re-record rather than needing two Radial EXTC's (they only have a mono send and return), unless I want to send stereo out in the first place?

Hope that all makes sense... Any input appreciated!

Guitar Effects," So I was wondering if anyone knows if it's possible to basically use a guitar pedal as an impulse response type thing and, I guess, ""sample"" it and then use it as a filter and separate effect during production? I have a multi effect guitar pedal, and I use amp Bias FX to record my guitar, but I obviously keep the DI guitar signal. However, when using the pedal, that goes straight in through my interface from the pedal itself, so the ""DI"" guitar signal is now coming directly from the pedal, meaning that it has an effect over it and is no longer a normal ""clean"" DI signal. I want to be able to ""sample"" the effect that's on the guitar somehow, so that I can record my guitar DI, but then still be able to use the effect that I want from my pedal. I know that I could just re-amp with the effect later, but I don't want to do that because sometimes playing with the effect on is what makes me play a riff or part of a song a certain way, so re-amping is something I want to avoid in this case. I'm not sure if this is possible, but anything would be appreciated. Links to any videos or any explanations... I'm also not wanting to have to dive too deep into the world of programming and DIY pluggins, so I would like to avoid all of that kind of stuff- Like I said, I just wanna be able to sort of ""sample"" the effect itself or the characteristic sound of it, and be able to apply it later as an effect like I would a reverb plugin or something. I use Reaper as my DAW if that helps or makes any difference in what my options are. Thanks! ",t2_1rhilfwu,1,0

Does Manhattan/parallel compression create a similar result to upward compression?,"I've been thinking about this.

Downward/standard compression: reduce the volume of anything over the threshold.

Upward compression: increase the volume of anything below the threshold.

Manhattan/parallel: Two tracks, one is compressed so that it is less dynamic. The other is uncompressed. So when combined, quieter moments will sound louder because of the presence of the compressed track. But louder moments will sound relatively unchanged because the compressed track is not adding as much volume, relatively speaking.

So the presence of the compressed track will act similarly to a ""minimum threshold"" in upward compression.

I understand that the mechanics work differently, but am I understanding that pragmatically they can be used in similar ways?",t2_5fqqn,0,0

Do you think the audio engineer will ultimately be replaced by algorithms and AI?,"As we move forward in the digital age I cant help but wonder if machine learning algorithms will become so advanced that people can get quality mixes without the need for an engineer.

I see mixing as a creative process that really comes down to taste rather than what’s right or wrong..

Using Two mics for vocals is the way to go!,"When the situation allows in studio I always use two mics of a lead vocal . One is often an SM -57 while the other can be a high quality large diaphragm mic. I notice I can eq the vocal to start by simply favoring the frequency of the mic that works best. Any two mics will work - but different mics are best compared to matched pairs. 

With rock bands I split the two tracks at about 10 and 2 o’clock. I put echo on one mic - usually the bright one . Then I mix without Eq. Using slight variation in pan - and I offset the time lines by a few 100ths of a second - more or less to taste - and it makes it thicker sound without being too loud in mix . Once I set the reverb I try to just leave it on the mic. Too much ? Then I pull the whole track down . 

So Once I do basic setup I mix with 4 parameters. The volume of each mic - and the pan . But I try not to off-set. The timeline too much . Just so I know it there . And you will find it interesting if you have the reverb mic channel hit before the dry one . 

Give it a try next time . It also works incredibly with solo instruments like a solo acoustic guitar. Try it. It may be just what the doctor ordered ! ? ",t2_8mrqz,93,0

Recording an Opera singer... for a rock song!,"TL; DR - I'm looking for guidance on recording a female opera singer. Particularly the kind of space I should record in, and the kind of mic to use - considering that it should fit with a grungy rock track.

&amp;#x200B;

There's an instrumental track on my latest project that just demands powerful female vocal performance. I've found a singer and as soon as I'm ready I'll book a session and get tracking.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that opera vocals can reach very high SPL. My instinct tells me to pick a nice big acoustic space, preferably well-treated, and to mic from more than a foot away to pick up some of that space. I could go for a church (because I might have cheap access to one). I'm sure the vocal recording itself would be ace, but I'm concerned that the church decay (or any large space) wouldn't match the 60 square meter room we recorded the band in. So should I go for close mic'ing in a small, dry/dead room instead?

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of mic choice, my instinct tells me to use my Stellar CM6 (tube-based, K67 style LDC) and probably have my Telefunken M81 closer as a backup. I also have an SE4400 (LDC) LRM-2 (ribbon), an AKG 451 (and other SDCs) and, of course, an SM57. What mics would you go for?

This is a question that might have an obvious answer, but I haven't been able to conclude it myself. And I didn't find anything on Google when I tried to search an answer (or maybe I didn't write the right question).

My question is: do distant sounds have less dynamic range than closer? This question popped to my head when I was mixing my track and wanted the sound to be futher.

"What exactly is ""pop"" mixing?","A lot of my clients keep mentioning they want a ""pop"" style mix. Even rock bands and folk bands, but especially rappers.

To me this means a brighter, more quantized ""perfection"" sort of tone within the mix. Usually consisting of a sparse but consice arrangement with not too much going on. Lots of simple catchy melodies with a ""pentatonic"" sort of vibe 

Big bright overly compressed in your face vocals, tight punchy ""small"" drums and tight, but huge low end. 

To me, I prefer rock bands to sound classic, that vintage sort of drum tone with a lot of room noise and reverb. The kick drum to be felt but not huge with low end and in your face. 

And a big vocal but with an organic sort of feel to the production.

 Think Fleetwood Mac or steely Dan. 

When someone mentions to me they want something to have pop mixing, my mind goes to these pre conceived notions, but I have a hard time applying them to music that was recorded analog with all real instruments. My brain just immediately hears that ""70s"" tapey vibe. 

Can anyone out there who works in pop explain to me how  to  go about mixing classically recorded instruments but with a modern ""pop"" sound in mind?

Mixing/producing varying amounts of guitars for indie-ish music?,"So my band is kind of post-rock influenced, if that helps. We're recording ourselves and for the most part we've had balanced guitar parts. We'll usually record two versions of each rhythm part..with different voicings, and hard pan them. And there's usually 2 lead-ish parts going on (but not really lead...more like just some arpeggios or little noodles here and there), which I've been panning less hard. So this way neither speaker is really fuller than the other, which..seems ideal? Is this the right way to go about this? And if there's one lead-ish part...should I still record the rhythm twice and hard pan it? I really like the trick of sending a reverb to the opposite speaker, so that helps some, but one part in particular of one of the songs feels weird and I was just hoping some people could share their thoughts/experiences and anything i should try or keep in mind.

Quick recording question: Waveforms and quantizing.,"Okay so say I have drummer Bob playing this AMAZING live track, but, during a part or two his kick drum or snare hit is 1/8th note off. IT's maddening listening to it because everything else sounds so perfect and good but this part. Or the same things happens with Jimmy's guitar solo: a couple notes are like 1/8th, 1/16th, 1/4th off, only a few of them are off the click track, but they are obvious.

I get quantizing with MIDI - you just drag around until the triggered audio lines up and sounds correctly. 

But, with these ""static"" audio tracks - I'm talking a complete recording from live musicians in audio waveforms, that aren't as easily editable: How is it done? Can someone step out the process for me? I see it like this:

Step 1) Cut the part that's off. 

Step 2) Now drag it to where it lines up on the grid. 

Step 3) Done! (Is it? Do I need to do anything else here? Like, now there's probably a gap or gaping hole in the audio waveform, which might skip or sound bad in the playback yes? So what to do?)

Someone else said you actually rarely cut and drag like this, but instead ""quantize"", like pressing a button. I know this is in pro tools, cubase, for MIDI, but is it also for waveforms? If you press that button doesn't it accidentally can possibly f^ck up some of the other notes track? Can you do it only on a single bar? ",t2_14dsl4,1,0

"Compression , saturation - loudness","Hello everyone , i want to permanently clarify something .

My aim for my mixes is somewhere -8 /-9 lufs (good for club play) 

To get there , i understood that i have to make a very balanced mix and a good mastering .

To reach a good loudness , i need COMPRESSION and SATURATION , right ?

Should i use compression and saturation on every track? 

The compression limits the peak of the sound and make it more liniar , right? 
The saturation increases the loudness without increasing the peak , right ? 

So , i should theoretically :

1.compress every track as long as it still sounds good .
2.saturate every track as long as it still sounds good. 

Extra: why should the kick be compressed ? It's a ""boom"" sound . It gets less punchier with compression . 
Should the sub bass (3xosc from fl studio) be compressed ? Or just saturated?

First Tracking Session,"Hello friends. 

So I am in search on some advice regarding tracking a full band session. I should preface with this:

First off, this will be my first time really “taking the board” and working with a band on a session. It should be said that I reached out to these dudes (one is a good friend), because I am trying to get better with the more technical side of music and recording music. We have all agreed that this will be a good growth opportunity for both parties and there won’t be any money exchanged and it will be a pretty casual day. 

That being said, I am trying to get some advice on things to watch out for and to be prepared for, as well as some pro tips on things like checking phase on drums, getting the best recordings possible with what I have to work with, and just silly avoidable mistakes that a rookie like me will probably still fall victim too. Any advice helps!

Also, as far as gear I will be running Logic Pro in my MacBook Pro and using a Zoom MRS 1608. I plan on mic’ing the room with my Bluebird condenser mic, using a SM 58 for vox, and the available drum and amp mics that they have to use. 

Thanks y’all!

Logic Pro - Parallel processing Latency Issues Resolved (sort of),"Hi there, I wanted to share with you a discovery I found while doing parallel processing in Logic Pro 8. (which I have a suspicion may still apply to Logic 9 and X).

Problem was that one of the main group busses was lagged by about 50ms or so than the rest of my main busses. (every channel was sent to one of 5 main group busses: 1) Drums,2) Instruments pumped with a sidechain, 3) Instruments I wanted no pump, 4) Bass and 5) ""wobble"" fx buss. All were outputting to output 1-2, except for wobble buss and reverb buss, which were both routed back to the instrument buss with sidechain, and this routing is exactly what was causing the problem.

I was able to test this by sending a snare hit to the buss in question, while simultaneously sending to one of the other busses (also tested with main out), and you would hear it slap twice. I was fearing that perhaps new york compression and other parallel processing techniques might encounter issues in Logic pro with latency issues due to some architectural 'error'. However, with a little experimentation, I was able to alleviate the problem. **The short short summary is that it seems logic may have issues with multiple auxes outputting to eachother, rather than when they all output directly to output 1-2.** 

\*Aux1: Instruments were sent to this buss for processing with an LFO to perform a 'wobble' filter effect (Serum FX) ---&gt; only send was to Aux2 for reverb, and outputted to Aux3 (main instrumentation ""pump"" buss). Serum FX had a side-chain input activated.

\*Aux2: Waves RVerb ---&gt;outputted to Aux3 (main Instrument ""pump"" buss). 

\*Aux3: Main instrument Buss with SSL buss compressor (sidechained to a kick drum captured from aux 20).

Aux 3 was lagging by the 50 or so ms compared to the other aux/buss groups. Latency was set to ""all"" in logic pro settings so in theory, compensation should have been all in alignment. But check this out: when I removed Aux1's reverb send, the latency disappeared. Likewise, when I changed the output from the reverb buss (aux2) from Aux 3 to output 1-2, the latency would also go away.  I should note, when I would remove all plugins from the reverb aux, this had no effect on latency (if still outputting to aux 3). So we might conclude that there was something about two separate aux channels (wobble buss and reverb buss) feeding into a common 3rd aux creating delay compensation issues with that particular aux channel. 

But theres more to the story: If I removed the sidechain from Serum FX on Aux1, the latency disappeared. it didn't matter what was going on with the reverb aux. So I thought maybe this was all due to a flaw with Serum. I removed Serum, added an ssl compressor to the same aux channel (aux1). Latency still gone, but then I added a sidechain to the compressor and guess what? latency back, and I could perform the same experiment above with the reverb channel. So there was something about having a sidechained aux and its send ultimately meeting at a final common aux that will cause it to experience faulty delay compensation. Remove either the Sidechain OR change the send routing, and the problem goes away. Weird right? Anyone want to chime in on what might be happening here? 

Interestingly, I have not been able to recreate this experiment all the time, it seems to happen at random. If I were to take a stab at what's going on here, I think it has something to do with how the busses/auxes are routed internally with logic when they are established initially, and how it relates to the delay compensation algorithm. Perhaps it depends on the order of when they are established, routed to eachother, or when the plugins are added...the list could go on and on. So I would suggest being aware that these problems may happen in Logic when auxes are being sent to other auxes and there is some sidechaning going on. Not a common issue or scenario I'm sure, but still something to bear in mind. 

Hopefully this wasn't too convoluted, but I invite you to repeat the experiment and see if you can come up with anything. ",t2_1qnf0se9,1,0
I can't hear the difference when mixing,"So I'm trying to mix some music I've been working on. I'm a musician, and I can say with confidence that I have pretty ""good"" musical ears. But man, I just don't hear most mixing stuff. For example, adding a bit of compression, or using different compressors with the same settings, adding a tiny bit of EQ, I just don't hear the difference. Of course if I compress something really hard or if I cut a lot of a freq. I hear a difference, but the small things I don't. For example, I bought some Waves plugins and everybody praises this J37 Tape Saturation, I just don't hear it doing anything haha.

Open circuit fault,"I’m working with an IP controlled amplifier made by QSC. Periodically I get an open circuit notification for one of the output audio channels. After a minute the notification goes away.

When did sound recording 'come of age'?,"Bit of a weird question; I'm hoping someone will be able to help! Apologies in advance if this is the wrong place to post.

It seems to me that audio recording took a huge leap forward in the 1960s. A great example of this would be The Beatles' output: 1963's *Please Please Me* sounds ancient, but move forward just five years to, say, *Sgt Pepper* and, to my ears, the recordings could almost have been made yesterday (in a pinch). Some recordings also seem to sound 'older' than some records which predate them. *Waterloo Sunset* by The Kinks and *A Whiter Shade of Pale* by Procol Harum sound particularly old to me, but were recording relatively late (1967 I think).

Anyway, apologies for the waffle, but what is it that distinguishes these 'old' sounding records from the ones which sound newer? Was there a significant advance in microphone technology or tape in this time? Was it just down to the mix or how the records were engineered? Thanks in advance!",t2_1zhryofh,79,0

Recording to External HDD w/ MacBook Air (internal SSD) - do RPMs still matter?,"Hi guys,

I've been out of the game for a few years now, but recently installed ProTools 12 on my MacBook Air (2017 model, has internal SSD) and since my storage space is low, I'm looking into getting an external HDD to record to. My budget is pretty low - was hoping to spend ~$50-75 for 500gigs-1TB. I'm not planning to record dozens of tracks simultaneously or put loads of effects on them, for now - just some light home audio/midi recordings as I become re-acclimated with the software (planning to go back to school for my MFA next fall so I realize I may need to upgrade my gear around then).

Anyway, my question is this: do I need to spring for a 7200 RPM drive to write audio to, or would 5400 be adequate? I've heard external SDDs are ideal, but they are quite expensive, even for the lower tiers of storage space.

If anyone has suggestions on decent budget external HDDs that would meet my needs, feel free to let me know. I'm more curious about the importance of RPMs for recording when my internal drive is solid state.

Disappearing Width,"Hey guys,

Lately I've been really trying to learn to get my mixes wider, and in particular my electric guitar tracks. I recently started playing with a trick I learned online to just put a stereo delay on a mono guitar track (either a signal designated stereo delay plugin, or ya know, making a mono copy, hard panning both, and then delaying one with a sample delay). This sounded good! I mean in a mix it sounded cool, and I could go full blown width at like 180 degrees with plenty of room in the middle, or I can throw a directional mixer on and reign it in a bit towards like 70% max width on these delayed signals. Either way it was cool, and then I started feeding that into a nice stereo hall reverb - it sounded nice. But then just to check the mix, I put a directional mixer on the stereo output and made it all mono. The volume of this orignally mono guitar track dropped drastically, whereas other mono elements in the mix did not, which proportionally made them seem WAY louder and sort of ruined the whole balance. I understand this has to do with phase cancellation (right?) so I am dealing with this because it was  originally a mono source sound, so I have to heavily modify the hard panned or almost hard panned edits to get them not to be so similar to each other that  I get cancellation.   


\-I really would just like advice on dealing with this problem that I created, for instance how would you make those two signals 'different enough' so I don't lose them summed in mono? Is it pitch correction up and down a few cents each? Or longer delay between each (rn I have like a 10 ms and a 20 ms delay respectively)

\- But also, sort of going back to my original issue, what do you guys do to give a nice wide aspect to a guitar track? This problem came up because I am better at guitar than piano. I recorded a track that I wanted to have the rhythm changes and harmony carried by an electic guitar mostly. This is tricky because it seems so naturally mono to me. Whereas something like a synth or electric piano carrying the harmony and playing the chord progression, naturally lends itself to a nice wide stereo image...  Am I thinking about this all right? I always feel like I have a decent understanding of stereo signal paths until I think too hard about it, then my understanding seems to disappear and I start questioning myself (is this cancelling out? Is this two hard panned mono sources or a single stereo source from my Yamaha DX7 hardware synth ? Are Logic X's stock E. Piano sounds two hard panned monos or is there a middle portion to the 'image' of the sound and if so, if I put a M/S processor on there and suck out the sides, am I left with a combination of the two sides with a different time delay? etc etc. I just sort of think myself in circles and start to feel dumb, second guess myself)  


I'd really appreciate any insight that gets me closer to a confident understanding of how to add width to 'chord' or harmonic instrument tracks, and the ability to call upon this skillset when I need it, instead of just sort of guessing and checking with different combinations of delays and multi tracking.

Is it possible to retrieve mono information after applying FX to the side part of a stereo sound?,"I am an EDM producer with limited engineering abilities and this subreddit is full of engineering geniuses, hence my post.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I discovered that if I resample a stereo sound, separate the mid and side channels, and pitch the side channel, I get a really cool smeary sound. However, if I apply some FX, even if I collapse to mono, I can still hear some of the pitching. In other words, it seems that somehow my side information is obtaining mid information after using various plugins like chorus, flanger, phaser, and applying additional unison. This causes weird issues when I resample a second time.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question: is it possible to retrieve mono information after applying FX to the side part of a stereo sound? I am trying to keep the two separate for creative/sound design purposes. My intuition says that since all side information will normally be silenced when in mono, this should be impossible, but somehow I got mid information from the effects, I think.",no author,3,0

Audio Mythology,"Hi everyone.

I'm a big fan of the ""tribal"" aspects of audio - the road stories and the stuff that gets passed down verbally for years. The problem with this, of course, is that stuff that's not true also gets repeated over and over again. I'm really interested by audio mythology, particularly the work of Ethan Winer, whose [Audio Myths Workshop from AES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYTlN6wjcvQ) is a great watch if you haven't seen it.

What I would like to know is this: **What was an audio-related belief that you carried for a long time before realizing it wasn't true?** For me it was that phantom power blows up ribbon mics. We've all been taught that it does, but it turns out not to be true, [despite having roots in a kernel of truth](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/study_hall/ask-jonah-addressing-a-long-standing-phantom-power-myth/). I personally never went for [speaker burn-in](https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/do-new-monitor-speakers-really-need-be-run-in) but a lot of people still believe it! A lot of misinformation out there as well about [sampling theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIQ9IXSUzuM) and array theory also. There's so much pseudoscience and nonsense in the ""audiophile"" circles (directional cables, and magic crystals, and the like) that I (and the professionals I know) just ignore it, but [loudspeaker isolation](http://ethanwiner.com/speaker_isolation.htm) does pop up from time to time.

These types of things are a topic of ongoing study and work for me. I'm interested in what other audio mythology is still out there floating around. Thanks for your time, everyone!

Tips for dealing with a very dynamic drummer,"Pretty new to all of this. I’m currently working on a psych rock project, and the drummer has parts where he’ll go from lightly tapping playing smooth jazz drums to beating the shit out of the drums like he’s playing hardcore. I reduced the input on the gain to keep everything from clipping during the heavy parts, but I’m getting a really weak signal in all of the other softer parts as a result. Should I be running the signals through compressors while we’re recording to prevent this or just record as is and worry about it later when mixing?",t2_19fl3c61,3,0
Ghost Notes in a Metal Song,"So strangely I've never encountered this before. But I'm mixing a heavier track and I'm trying to get a huge snare sound.

How could I attach a mic clip to this clamp? Mounting drum room mics,"In the studio there is a 6"" wide wood trim around the back top of the room where we always put our drum room mics, about 8 feet tall. It sucks always having really tall mic stands cluttering up the back of the room, we usually have three and they always get in the way. I want to find a way to clamp to this trim (without damaging the wood) and mount a mic clip to it. 

I [found](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/860794-REG/impact_me_106_6_end_jaw_vise.html) [this clamp](https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images500x500/impact_me_106_6_end_jaw_vise_1382469913000_860794.jpg) that is the perfect dimensions, but I think this kind of clamp is for gaffers and lighting grips, so it comes with a 5/8"" pin instead of a threaded mic clip mount, plus even if it was threaded it wouldn't be adjustable. I couldn't find any standard mic clip mounts that have a 6"" wide opening that could clamp to this. So maybe I'd have to get another clamp to clip to the vertical bar, something like [this one.](https://media.sweetwater.com/api/i/f-webp__q-82__ha-90ddb2c0e05e5c0e__hmac-4ab87dde3c9cc584eef7efbb619882595510d50b/images/closeup/750-MicStdExtBrkS_detail1.jpg)

Tips for taming the bass guitar?,"I'm mixing an indie rock track for a friend of mine. A live recording with one Guitar, one bass guitar, electric keyboard, and drums. I used a AKG D112 on the bass cab and also tracked a DI signal.
I am curious if anyone had any tips or ideas they use in their own mixes to make the bass sit juuuust right. What I usually struggle with when mixing bass is the awful resonance that can pop up between 100-200hz.
I first will try EQ'ing the overbearing frequencies out, nothing too drastic. But usually I find that without them the bass loses all of its presence, in this song especially. The DI track is a bit shitty so I am relying on the D112 much more.

Graphical retuning after recording a live autotune session?,"If I record a session with autotune (auto mode, not graphical retuning) on and leave the recording wet (I know maybe not the best practice), can I still come in and slap a graphical retune like wavestune or Antares graphical mode on top to fix small errors? Or will this sound poor? I’m asking because I like the way that Antares autotune auto mode sounds, but I hate using the graph mode for the life of me and would rather use a different plugin (wavestune or melodyne) for post-recording adjustments. I guess what I could do is record the session dry but with autotune monitoring and then use wavestune or melodyne after to do all tuning, including the little adjustments. I just really like the way that Antares does the live retuning. I could also just use the graph software on the wet vocal to only touch up the parts that are problematic, and turn off the pitch blocks where I already like the sound.  Sorry if this is confusing...

"My utter frustration with the ""Produced by"" credit...","I've been working as a professional engineer/mixer/quazi-producer for over ten years. Mostly with local independent artists, some small label, and some major label artists.

Since the majority of my clients are rap/hip-hop artists, the proliferation of the misused ""producer"" title has really been driving me nuts. Yes, I've had the conversation MANY times with MANY of my artists, but I still feel like it's a conversation that needs to be re-had damn near ever session or every album release.

&amp;#x200B;

9 times out of 10 one of my clients come in with just lyrics and an instrumental. Either tracked out, or just the 2 track. I then proceed to go over the entire song before recording even starts. Song structure, melodies, arrangement, etc. They track their vocals, then sit on the couch while I completely rearrange the instrumental, add or remove instruments, create vocal melodies and harmonies out of thin air, and hand them a completed masterpiece in only a few hours.

I turn 4 minutes of a static unchanging 4 bar loop into a song with multipart arrangements that actually develops and breathes.

100,000 views

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously... What the fuck. I feel like it's a losing battle. No matter how many times I explain what a producer is, what an engineer is, what a songwriter is, and what a got dam beat maker is, if the meaning doesn't change in the popular lexicon, it doesn't matter. I never have this problem with my clients in other genres. And it really didn't bother me for a long time. I KNEW I made that song happen, and so did the artist. That's all that mattered. But as more and more people get credit for my work, people that my artist has never met, nor have I, and who never heard the song or had anything to do with the process, it starts to wear on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the diatribe.

&amp;#x200B;

TDLR: I'm tired of tracks that I created with a client, tracks that I spent my time and creativity on, having the credit go to someone who had zero to do with the track, simply because of the confusion and misuse of the term ""producer"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit: There seems to be a bit of confusion. Let's lay out an example:**

Artist comes in with lyrics for a hook, 2 verses, and a beat that consists of a 3 minute 4-bar drum loop (without the hi hats in the intro of course), a single bass line loop, and 1 lead synth.

&amp;#x200B;

I take that track, cut it up into pieces, add instruments, remove elements, and structure out a song with:

intro-1st verse - pre-chorus - chorus - 2nd verse - pre-chorus - chorus - bridge - chorus - chorus.

&amp;#x200B;

Artist goes into the booth, lays down whatever vocals they have written.

Comes out, we sit down and listen, talk about what will work, what would be a good idea, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Artist sits, I go to work. Tweaking vocals, pitching vocals, creating melodies, adding backing vocals, maybe even cutting certain bars that just don't work or re-arranging them. I create an 8-bar bridge out of preexisting vocals from other parts in the song. I usually create some sort of outro, and add extra elements in the last hook.

Then mix, master, finish.

Tips on Starting A Professional Recording Studio,"Hello, I have been recording out of my house for almost three years and want to go 'professional'. And before you ask, ""What does this moron mean by 'professional'"" Let me explain.   
I have always been into engineering. Ever since I got my hands on my first Tascam Ministudio cassette recorder; I have been fascinated. I used to try and record exactly what I heard on CD's and vinyl onto my cassette deck and attempt to make it sound equal and or better. Years passed, I played in a band and recorded our own music. That's when I decided I wanted to take the process of recording and chasing the ""perfect"" sound to the next level.  
I started recording out of my house and have slowly gained the reputation around my area for having the best sound, easiest to work with, and cheapest prices. This has gone on for a couple years, and now I want to achieve more. What I'm asking is; what are some tips or general guidelines, per-say, that I can follow that can help me better achieve my goals of being professional and making an honest living off of engineering? I know the basics such as marketing, being a people person, and how to get something to sound almost exactly how I wanted it to, but I want to know more of;  
\-How to secure a new recording spot (?)  
\-Is there an actual legality spectrum of recording that goes under the radar for the most part? (Loans, LLC's, Investors?)  
\-How can I maximize my reach to artists outside of my area (?)  
\-Basics fundamentals of a legitimate recording business  


I absolutely want engineering and recording to be my life career as it seems nobody can hear what I hear (Cocky, I know, but its something engineer's understand) and I want to pursue it as legally and as straight forward as I can.  


Thank you, I look forward to replies. Remember, dress to compress :-) ",t2_ql49hq4,5,0
Binaural IR's for use in stereo,"Hello!

Recording vocals with dynamic mic,"I am a so-called bedroom producer and I'm looking to record my own vocals for a rock album. I have both a condenser (Blue Yeti -- yes, I know this is bottom-barrel and typically used by podcasters) and a dynamic (Sm58, also not the highest-end mic in the world) -- I have a Steinberg UR22 interface.

&amp;#x200B;

I really have to say I prefer the dynamic mic for two reasons 

&amp;#x200B;

1: I have a high-pitched voice, closer to a tenor than baritone. I notice the dynamic mic tends to darken the sound and seems to lessen the more shrill or nasally frequencies, which is a plus

&amp;#x200B;

2: Since I'm doing my vocals at home (I've also thought of renting a hotel room for this), I like that the dynamic is not as sensitive and I don't have to be as worried about reflections, ambient noises being picked up, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that typically condensers are used for studio recording, although I've heard of artists using dynamics in rare instances. Anyone here have any experience or suggestions for this recording method? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't have the budget to rent studio time and all that, as silly as it sounds, this is more of a personal album and I am obviously not expecting studio quality. Just good enough that I can share my tunes and see if they get any attention. If so I may invest in re-recording everything with better equipment in a more professional way.",t2_1qt96mro,2,0
Preset advice! Recording Album with UA Apollo Twin,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to take my home recording to the next level and I recently purchased a UA apollo twin Duo MKii and a new desktop Mac (using Logic). The album I want to pursue is going to be acoustic guitar, keyboard and vocals with other electronic effects added in from different presets on Logic. My question is:

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any recommendations on specific presets for acoustic guitar? I have been going through the stock ones and I am not a fan of any of them. I want a bit of a warmer/ambient feel than what I can find, and everytime I try to create my preset it is full of static. I do like the UAB-610B but other than that everything starts to get confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help appreciated.

Amount of signal loss when splitting a signal?,"I'm finding seemingly conflicting information all over on this one, I'm hoping someone can offer a definitive source.

Let's say you plus a dynamic microphone into a passive, Y signal splitter. How much of a decrease will there be in dB out of each output compared to the input?

Some people suggest it's 3dB as you're cutting the power in half.

Others suggest it's 6dB as you're cutting the voltage in half.

Others suggest it will be less than 1dB (more or less) due to the impedance in the circuit (the exact amount can be derived by using Ohm's Law)

Anyone have a solid answer to this?",t2_q098f,49,0

Can't seem to get a good DI bass sound,"I just bought a bass guitar to record some lines at home. I have no bass amp and I'm using the DI only (a Focusrite Scarlett Solo). I've used the Scarlett before with my guitars and even though it doesn't sound fantastic (big surprise), I've been able to get a nice, clean sound that has been easy to EQ and use plugins for.

Not with the bass, however. I've tried fiddling with the gain and the settings on the Scarlett, and I've tried EQ and compressor in my DAW, but that wont help if the signal is bad. It sounds terrible, with this strange digital distortion (even with low input gain), with the low notes too loud and the higher notes too quiet and they also have this wierd digital ""phaser"" sound to them. I don't know how to explain it.

Tips for having a balanced Vocal FX Chain for Broadcasting?,"Shure SM7B (and EV RE20) w/ a Triton Fethead and Audient iD14.

&amp;#x200B;

**#1 - Gate** \- I some have background noise (air conditioning).  I want the gate to be set so that it reduces background noise without making my breaths choppy.  How would I want to set the threshold and ratio to handle this?  Do I want a gradual slope under the threshold or keep the threshold conservative but cut off everything under it?

**#2 - Equalizer** \- Purely subtractive.  No additive EQ or coloration.  LPF starts around the 18k area.  Is that too high for any meaningful benefit?  With the HPF, I want to partially control harsh lows.  I want to still have some proximity effect, but not abuse it like some broadcasters do.   What effect would tapering down from 100 vs. cutting sharply at 40-50 have?

\#3 - **Limiter / Compressor / Multiband Compressor** \- I'm not exactly sure what combination of these I should have.  I would like more than one  so none of them need to be doing too much work.  Do I want the Limiter to hard-correct my voice only when it gets really loud or be done on a more gradual basis.  With the multiband compressor, I'd compress my the bulk of vocal range only so any background noise or sibilance wouldn't be unintentionally amplified.  For a male with a relatively average voice (not particularly high pitched or deep), what range would I be looking at?  200-1000 Hz?

First Live Sound Job - What to Expect?,"A friend of mine approached me yesterday, asking if I wouldn't mind the sound desk / mixing console for them for a bunch of upcoming shows at the start of next year.

&gt;I have 0 experience setting up live sound (expect from within recording studios), however have been to a lot of gigs as a punter

The band have offered to pay me and ""throw in some beers"", so this can be seen as a job offer, but for me it's more a good opportunity to begin my career within live sound, considering I have a good friendship with them already.

Best way to route MIDI-enhanced VST through analog effects and back for recording?,"I'm running a korg Monologue that is connected into my DAW (FL12, but also could do Reaper or Tracktion 4) via USB for use as a MIDI controller. I have a plugin I'm using to emulate a synth, let's say FM8. 

Then I have two DACs available to me, a digidesign mbox 2 and a behringer xenyx Q502USB. I want to route the output from FM8 through an EHX cathedral stereo reverb and delay and then back into my computer for recording on a different track, post processed. Is there an easier way to do this? 

Ideally the cathedral will be mono in, stereo out (1/4""), into the xenyx rather than the mbox, because the xenyx has stereo in and is five channel (mbox is stereo if you use both available channels).

I need all the other channels open and free of effects processing for Volca beats and one for mic/guitar/PO-20.

I don't think both DACs can be in use at the same time, so I can't go from the output of the mbox into the the xenyx and be able to record on the latter. I can't pull audio from headphone jack with ASIO drivers pushing output to the DAC. 

FM8 can run as a standalone app. You think that would do it? What about other plugins that are made for use in a DAW? Do I just need a second computer?",t2_5jrjr,6,0

How can I tame an FM synth?,"Hey all. I play synths in a little experimental pop duo, and I'm a bit puzzled by FM synths. Whereas my analog and virtual analog synthesizers tend to be manageable when recording direct to a Tascam, my Volca FM has proven to be a high-frequency monster. I had to use a lot of EQ to tame the high-end, and even then, the tunes that rely on FM tend to stand out among the rest.

What strategies would you recommend? An equalizer prior to going into the Tascam? Filter it by processing it via one of my analog synths?",t2_1umnn1h,1,0
Recording Impulse Responses for Speaker Virtualization,"Speakers can be virtualized (simulated) with headphones very convincingly with impulse responses and convolution software. This however requires the impulse responses to be measured for the individual listener and headphones. I'm trying to achieve this.

I made impulse response recordings by playing sine sweep on left and right speaker separately and measuring it with two ear canal blocking microphones. I turned these sweep recordings into impulse responses with Voxengo deconvolver software. I also measured my headphones the same way and compensated their frequency response with an EQ by inverting the frequency response as heard by the same microphones. Impulse responses are quite good and certainly better than any other out of the box impulse response I have ever heard. However they are suffering a little by coarseness, sound signature is a bit bright and sound localization is a tad fuzzy.

When listening on headphones a music recording which was recorded with the mics in ears while playing the music on speakers the result is practically indistinguishable from actually listening to speakers. My impulse responses and convolution come close but still leaves me wanting for better. I think the main problem might be the noise introduced by my motherboard mic input.

I thought about using digital voice recorder like Zoom H1n for the job. This model can do overdub recordings with zero delay between the playback and recording making it possible even to record each speaker separately. I'm also assuming that the mic input on this thing is quite a bit better than my PCs motherboard.

Does is seem like sensible idea to use voice recorder and are there better options? Can you think of other sources of error than the noise from the mic input? Should I do some digital noise filtering on the sine sweep recording before running the deconvolution? Any other ideas for improving the impulse responses?",t2_42dngn,1,0

I'm going deaf and I only have myself to blame,"I have never had great ears, I had surgery on my mastoids when I was in my early teens iand it worked to an extent to clear up the issues that I had previously.

As I went through my teens in the 90s, I was inspired by the regular grunge outfits of the era to start playing guitar. This lead on to me doing sound production at university, getting really into production and spending many long hours in the studio, either listening to monitors or headphones but using my ears for the most part of the day.

After uni I got a job for a year working live crew for a PA company. To start with this was just lugging equipment around, but soon got to setting up stages and then working the desk with the engineers. It was an awesome job and I loved it. 
I got to learn how to get sounds that took me hours to achieve in the studio, quickly, and to also learn how to mix and fix on the fly. 

After that year, I moved and although working a full time job, I got a gig at a local studio with a couple of producers that wrote for other people. There was a lot of just making drinks and keeping everyone happy but I learnt so much from those guys. 

One of the perks of the job was that there was a little mixing studio in the loft that I could use as my own. I spent hundreds of hours in that studio, as much as I could without dropping from sleep deprivation. I would often get back from work on a Friday, go straight to the studio and then go back home about 10pm Sunday to get ready for Monday (the studio had living quarters).

I got signed, I released music and I remixed and although I never made money from it, I always thought that I would never regret what I had done. I always viewed it as 'I may never get this opportunity again' so I pushed and pushed.

Now, here I am ten years later and most nights I cannot sleep from my tinnitus, it is a constant manifestation of pitch from which I rarely get any relief. 
My left ear has about 20% of the hearing it should have, my right has about 60% and the prospect of losing my hearing altogether in the next 10 years is very real. 

It turns out that I was an idiot. I knew my ears were not great. I knew I should not just keep turning the monitors up when I got fatigue and that listening to drums on headphones for 6 hours straight was a bad idea. But I did it anyway, because I was young, I had passion and I wanted to make it man. I knew the risks, threw them to the wind and now it is blowing back.

***^little ^vent:***

I'm finding myself more interested in how things work with audio than actually making/finishing music; I can sit down for 8+ hours learning about (and doing) editing/mixing but I've never done the same with writing or producing, which is making me feel kind of lost. 

As a musician I'm happy with the following I've made and the opportunities I have, I've always wanted to try to make a career out of it, but now I'm wondering if it'd be better to move to a different field in music (mixing.)

Can someone explain the poor digital sound quality of some hit rock albums? Do these sound better on vinyl?,"My specific examples are:

1.  Just about anything Bob Seger recorded mid-70's - early-80's.  I'll just use *Night Moves* (1976) as an example.

2.  Most of Queen's hit records seem to have the same problem.  I'll use the album version of *Bohemian Rhapsody* from *A Night at the Opera* (1975) as an example.

Forgive my lack of vocabulary.  But the best way I can explain what I mean is that the records I'm referring to sound flat and highly compressed.  I can even hear a ""hissing"" in these recordings.  ANY amplification seems to exacerbate the issue.  It's sad because this is music you want to play *loud*.  But you turn it up, and it's like it's behind a facade.

I own these albums on CD, I have quality lossless rips of them from other sources, and have heard them a million times on the radio.  Are they better on vinyl?  Did something happen in the transfer?

I've googled quite a bit to try to find commentary on this, but while I've found critics and fans echoing the problem of poor production, I haven't really found anything I would call an explanation as to *why*.  I appreciate any insights on this.

Playing sequential audio files so that they sound like one long track,"I have a script that I'm working on, where we are recording around 200 script lines, and 900 names. We are using the names as a part of the script, so that we say a sentence like ""here is the report for Steven"", which is a combination of an mp3 containing ""here is the report for"" and another mp3 containing ""Steven"", or any of the other names. In addition to this, we are also just playing files sequentially without names, so that we might have ""here is your report"" and then ""covering the time from January to March"".

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a pain in the ass to say the least. Because we are working with so many lines, we get fatigue from our voice actors, and invariably the lines all sound different. They are different volumes, different speeds, different intonation, and it is very obvious that these are separate recordings being Frankensteined together to produce the audio track.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is how is this solved by other people? Do you have to manually master each audio file, even when it might be combined with potentially thousands of other possible files? Do you avoid combining sentences like this? Do you record an entire script and then chop it up afterwards? I am an audio noob, and any advice would be greatly appreciated, about how you would go about the task of a single audio track being built from potentially thousands of audio files.",t2_12thjw,1,0

Can anyone help me out with this thought experiment involving the nature of reverb/acoustics?,"Although I'm a trained musician, I'm an amateur sound guy, so apologies if this is really obvious.

Whenever you take a sound and play it against its exact inversion, the result is silence, since one sound wave cancels each other out. My understanding is that this can be useful to illustrate things like what is lost when going between a wav or FLAC file to a lossy, compressed one.

**Thought experiment** - if I made two recordings, one right after the other, of some sound being played on a set of speakers in a hall, inverted one of them, and played them together, presumably they would not be exactly, sonically identical. But since every other possible variable is accounted for - same sound, same speakers in the same position, same mics in the same position, same hall at *nearly* the same moment, what would account for those differences? 

Is reverberation simply random, or is it approximately the same reflections every time, given similar conditions?

VCA Faders vs. Aux Channels - Help Me Understand,"I have been doing a ton of research on how to use VCA faders in my workflow. The benefits that they add make a ton of sense for dealing with automation and other volume elements.

My biggest question is this (please bear with me as I attempt to phrase my question properly):

I typically run all of my drums into an Aux Channel for processing as a group (Comps, saturation, mild eq, reverb etc.). If I create a VCA Fader for all of the drum channels and perform automation it will pull the individual drum faders up and down which would then be affecting the global output of the drum tracks to the Aux Channel. This would then mess with my Compressor Thresholds and such. Are my thoughts about VCA Faders incorrect and is there a better way to be using them?

*EDIT*
Thank you everyone for your amazing responses. If anything this thread got me thinking more about how to use them for my own application. Yes I was calling it an Aux Channel (Thats what Protools creates them as) but I did mean a Bus. Looks like I was kind of right thinking that it wouldn't work ""properly"" when using a bus that has saturation or compression on it. That being said, being able to push into those saturation and compressor plugins would be very cool on certain parts of songs that call for it.

Word Clock Sanity Check,"Quick question here I've got three devices of which two have BNC &amp; lightpipe ports, while the third only has lightpipe. In running word clock signal to all of them it looks like this:

* Focusrite Word Clock Out (BNC) --&gt; Motu828 Word Clock In (BNC) --&gt; Motu8Pre Lightpipe In
* Focusrite is the master for 828. 828 is the master for 8pre.

Does that flow look right?

Everything gets set to the correct sample rate (48k) as defined at the Focusrite so it seems like it's working right however the lock light on the 828 does not illuminate and I've got no other way to tell if the device is locked. When I pull the BNC cable coming from the Focusrite, the sample rate light on the 828 (and 8pre) blinks and sets to a different value, which I think is good enough for me to indicate that information is flowing from the 1st device (Focusrite).

At any rate it might be a non-issue as I almost never record from these devices simultaneously. Is that right? Or should they always be locked to each other regardless of activity?",t2_dcsyl,1,0

Questions about uploading to Bandcamp,"Hello everyone! I've uploaded a few albums to Bandcamp, and I've noticed a few issues that I don't know how to fix.


1) Does Bandcamp do any mastering? When streaming or listening to the downloaded files, some tracks are inexplicably louder or quieter than the previous. My albums are supposed to flow from one track to the next, so this sudden change in volume is a major problem.


2) How do I add the metadata to my tracks? When downloading the files and opening them in iTunes, there are no artist names, album names, artwork, etc. Other albums that I have downloaded from Bandcamp have all of that information by default, just like they had been purchased through the iTunes store.

"I have some questions regarding volume, distance drop off, and using an spl meter.","So I just recently bought the BAFX advanced sound meter (link: [http://a.co/d/f50l0BG](http://a.co/d/f50l0BG)). I am going to use this to measure the volume of my bluetooth speakers and headphones and make sure that they are under 75 decibels (preferably 70 decibels.) Now I bought this meter because I could set it between fast and slow and use either a or c weighting.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have the basic one and it's ok but I've noticed that whenever I use it and place it right on the speaker it registers about 90 db. When I move it an inch away it drops to 80 or so and when I move it further away it of course drops.

&amp;#x200B;

However I've read that you need to be at least five feet away (preferably seven) for the actual sound volume and pressure to be -6db from what is coming out of the speaker. Whenever i've used my basic sound meter to measure the volume though it gradually drops off and registers sometimes as 85 decibels by the speaker but when six feet away about 60 decibels. That can't be right can it?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried because I listened to music about an average of four hours at around 90 db on Tuesday. Not all at once but four hours spread out between a fourteen hour period. Sixty minutes here, one hour later another sixty minutes, four hours later a ninety minute period, and five hours after that thirty minutes for the last. I know that's bad but at least there were breaks right?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So tl;dr I have three questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How exactly do I use an spl meter?

2. What is the distance for volume and sound pressure drop off from an audio source?

3. I follow the rules that abide by the 85 db and for each 3 db extra cut the exposure time in half rule. However is that continuously or if I take breaks can that be lengthened?

Why are my choir recordings so dry and thin?,"I've been attempting to record the concerts of a choir where I am the assistant conductor, with limited success.  The choir has around 70-80 singers usually with a good enough balance of numbers between the voices and at least sounds pretty good live.  The choir usually performs in modern churches around 300 seats with various degrees of acoustic treatment and are usually not very reverberant, so none of those 3 second echos of old cathedrals.  

Currently I use the Tascam HD-40 on a stand placed 1m behind the conductor, with the mics around 2m off the floor.  The choir would be standing on steps / choir risers in 3-4 rows, standard choir configuration.  The recording I've gotten over past concerts have been disappointing - it tend to pick out some voices more than others, is very dry and thin and sound nowhere near as good as the choir is live.  It also seem to me that all room acoustics is not picked up (is this how it's supposed to be?).  Other positions I've tried:

* Placing the recorder at the back of the hall but that didn't work either - audience noise became a major problem.  
* Placing the recorder in front of the conductor at a low position but that didn't quite work either - in that case it would only pick up the middle chunk of singers.
* Placing the setup in front of the balcony was hit and miss, often affected by audience and also would block view.

How should I get about improving the recordings?  I've been pondering moving the setup further back down the aisle, but would need good justification for that to convince my music director as it will start to affect the audience.  Or should I look at acquiring some better gear?  As this is not a professional organization there is no budget, I'll have to purchase any gear myself.

Recording dialog for video - mono 320kbps MP3 or WAV?,"Hey everyone--

I usually record video dialog with my Rode NTG-2 running into my Tascam DP-008EX and it sounds great. But some of the stuff I have started to produce needs to be pumped out faster, and in many cases I'm a one-man crew and can't operate a shotgun mic on a boom with a moving subject, so a lav becomes the obvious choice. These are effectively zero-budget productions for the time being, so no knocking my cheap gear :D

I have two options and would like your input as to which you think is going to sound better at the end of the day. First is the Voice Record Pro app on my iPhone, with a cheap lav made for recording to mobile devices--[this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016C4ZG74/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to be precise. I have used this in a couple of videos so far and been pleasantly surprised with what I got considering the entire setup was about $10 (minus the iPhone which I already had, obviously). The settings I used were:

* WAV format
* 44,100 sample rate
* Bit depth = 16 bits
* Mono

This generates files roughly 5.3 MB per minute, or just north of 700 kbps.

My second option would be the same lav mic, but plugged into a Sony ICD-AX412 voice recorder. This recorder's best settings give me 320 kbps MP3 files.

My layman's understanding of the finer points of audio engineering tell me that WAV &gt; MP3 if I'm going to put it into Adobe Audition to clean up a bit before using in my video, and that 700 kpbs &gt; 320 kbps. That said, I also feel like bitrate isn't directly comparable between a filetype like WAV and something fairly heavily compressed like MP3. Also, the dedicated voice recorder is appealing for a few reasons such as convenience, battery life, and perhaps fewer hardware limitations in terms of getting a clean audio signal from the mic to the file?

Classical vs modern classical recording style,"Recently I've taken on a recording project for a modern piece and it has generated discussion in my class about modern classical recording. 

My professor generalized that the more modern the piece the more isolated the individual instruments were, whereas the goal of classical typically is to blend. 

So the theory I think is that you spot them more and leave a little less to your main pair. 

Do you think this is a correct assessment about modern classical sound in terms of purely recording? Obviously post-production plays a huge role (and the music itself being in a different universe). 

I've been trying to find examples of this sound in pieces I like but I think that the pieces tend to be so drastically different that it's hard to make a judgment call as to how the recording factors in. 

Do you know of any piece that has been recorded in each of the two styles I've alluded to? 

The two I found are this piece, [modern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI3IHt-cD5Q), and this for [classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObF-ujCIdr8). I think my issue is that the Sakamoto piece has synthesizers and probably processing on the violins.

Does anyone know if anything like that still exists? It's such a cool and generous thing to do, considering i think it was just some guy who did it for fun",t2_1mbn47dz,2,0
Soften peaking,"I have a some VO lines and there are parts of lines that either peak or are on their way to peaking. I'm working in Logic Pro X. I can try and animate the audio keys to help, but it's tedious and sometimes it just doesn't get it to sound right. I'm very skeptical of bouncing with normalization because I've had a lot of wonky things happen with normalization and I can't control it on bounce. I figure there has to be a decent way to make this a bit easier (Aside from using the Compressor's Limiter since I find that can be pretty harsh on the compression).

Is there a good method to try automate it to soften peaking or normalize the sounds?

What does a blow to the head sound like ... From the inside?,"I need to create a realistic sound of a baseball bat hitting someone in the head (probably Foley, but I'm open to suggestions).

But here's the twist: I want to get the sound from the perspective of the person who gets hit. From inside their head. Any ideas about how to go about doing this?

Emphasis on drama over realism. This sound effect will be an integral part of a song, and I want the listener to viscerally feel the victim's pain, on speakers or headphones.",t2_o447i,1,0
[Mastering Discussion] Achieving loudness without transient loss,"Before I go into this and before anyone comments, I'd prefer and greatly appreciate if any ""loudness war"" or ""why are you mastering for loudness in 2018"" or ""streaming services normalize levels"" type comments be withheld.

Anyways, I was wondering how mastering engineers go about achieving such loud masters while still retaining such sharp transients and attack. To my understanding, one of the things that can be done during the mastering process include reducing the peaks (with limiting or compression) so the levels of the track are consistent enough to where you can bring the overall volume up and not peak all over the place. However, in my (admittedly limited [no pun intended]) experience, when doing this, I experience a loss of attack in the transients, most easily evident in the drums- all the bite is gone, they sound somewhat mushy. Is it a trade off? Meaning, do you have to find the right balance between overcompression/limiting and loudness?

Any advice, techniques, opinions on the topic are welcome... interested in learning as much as I can and helping out others who might also be curious about this. Thanks!",t2_9hrxh,4,0

\- use my own hanging picture frame acoustic treatment (just 50cm ish squares of shaped foam) and a rug instead of the carpet for the polished wooden floor;

\- sit a desk and monitors either under the window or on the wall opposite the fireplace.

limiter on lead vocals?,"Vocals are tricky, your own vocals are trickier, but I'll try and keep this straightforward.
