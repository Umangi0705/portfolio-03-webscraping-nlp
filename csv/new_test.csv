is a thunderbolt audio interface worth it for a small home studio right now i record through a crappy audiobox usb from many year ago and feel it s time to upgrade i play a fender strat and have a moog mono synth and elektron s digitone digitakt and analog four this leaf me needing preferably 6 input a i ll probably route one elektron into the other at a minimum i d also like a bit of room for expansion so let s say max even in a few year i ll need 12 input even if i need a secondary preamp is thunderbolt worth it or should i save some cash and just go for usb i m looking for an improvement in sound quality better preamps and also a reduction in noise which could be completely my fault and not the audiobox usb s i ve still got a few thing to try and get rid of the noise my biggest pet peeve though is the latency between playback and input so when i want to jam over something i recorded i have to put the mixer in the center and everything ha a huge delay on it which is terrible for my productivity and the volume are low overall hearing wise the direct to daw input is very enticing for me but i still do not know if it is worth the 1 000 any help is appreciated,0
what s the difference b/w dithering and truncation it s my basic understanding that dithering is adding low inaudible noise to cut off distortion and that it s the final step to the mastering process while truncation is simply cutting off bit resolution which in turn creates quantization error am i right,0
getting wide auto panning to sound right/auto panning trick tip i ve noticed that a lot of song i really enjoy use a good bit of auto panning dave fridmann seems to really like using it the sound tend to be shaker tambourine or higher pitched dreamy sounding synths i tend to have a hard time making auto panned sound fit in the mix well the element easily start to seem too on top of the mix one dimensional and obnoxious i have tried widening the sound before and after auto panning i ve also tried using reverb after the auto panning but i still am not getting the sound i m looking for in most case do you have any auto panning tip or trick how do you get it to add movement and excitement in your mix without sounding overbearing,0
how do you separate multi track's onto different desk channel sorry if this is the wrong sub or a really stupid question but planning to buy some equipment and set up a home studio not really a studio to get a grip with the really in depth mixing and eq stuff obviously without any live input this will rely on multi track i dont understand how it can go from the main file to being patched onto different desk channel surely the desk still see it a one input a it will just be a signal from a laptop is it software that can separate it up so the desk see it a different input again sorry if it's a very obvious question we are mainly based around live sound and don't really do much software/pre recorded work thanks in advance,0
static hiss coming from laptop when using headphone i have a laptop that i can hear noise from when there should be silence i can deal with it when listening to music or watching video but it's kind of annoying when producing or mixing i have an interface that i can plug in and that solves it but i don't like to carry it around all the time i wa wondering if a usb headphone amp like this http //www amazon com/fiio portable headphone amplifier dac/dp/b0189evgag/ref mp_s_a_1_16 ie utf8 qid 1545252662 sr 8 16 pi ac_sx236_sy340_fmwebp_ql65 keywords fiio headphone amp would likely solve the issue the noise is not always there but any time i have a video/audio application running it will be there even if it's not in play mode the second i close those program it's gone,0
suggestion for isolating small studio room on a budget hi all opened up my new mixing room here in brooklyn and i'm trying to figure out the cheapest most efficient way to isolate the noise in my room and prevent it from hitting my neighbor i'm in a multi faceted studio building with many tenant and i have 2 neighbor on either side of me turn out the wall do not have any insulation installed between them only 2 panel of sheetrock against stud my room is 115 sf it's small but it's enough for what i do so i don't really have the space to build a room within room setup i've already been lectured about how having more mass will be the best solution but i just don't have that kind of space i'm looking for a solution that will at least dampen my output to the neighbor p s i considered posting to r/acoustics but their community is a lot smaller than this one so i figured i'd give it a shot here,0
confusion about automation in general hey guy i feel like a lot of famous audio engineering say that good automation is going to make the biggest difference between an amateur mix and a professional one i can see why people say this but i'm still not sure what exactly i'm supposed to be automating what am i supposed to be trying to achieve with automation thanks,0
gold star studio chamber isolated ronettes recording i'm a fanatic for that old gold star/phil spector sound and i just heard this for the first time the clap at the beginning and ronnie's opening woah oh s might be the cleanest isolated example of the sound and long decay of the chamber at gold star the tail overlap but it sound like it might be at least a good 3 second edit i got a rough estimate from one of the long clap and counting/converting the bpm and it's around 3 1 second at least on a cell phone speaker http //youtu be/zm4wljd6clg,0

question about level clipping while mixing drum tried this in another sub but got no response please let me know if this is more appropriate in another sub firstly it it's worth mentioning i'm using reaper on window 10 wondering if anyone else ha this issue while mixing specifically with drum first off i make sure i record my level peaking 6db i take time to make sure my source is the best it can be before it go into the daw when i'm mixing i watch my level and main fader to make sure i'm not peaking above 12db and yet my drum can't stop clipping the only effect i'm adding on my 4 track are eq light compression and light reverb i don't hear clipping they sound good but i have to either turn down my main fader like 15 25 to avoid seeing the level clip or turn down the individual faders a lot the other problem i have is when i do have a good drum sound when i slowly begin to ease my other instrument in the drum become buried in the mix and it make it feel like all the processing i did is never heard if i do hear the drum i have to keep my instrument down but then that make the mix sound sort of lop sided and weak i also use high pas filter on my guitars/vocals and generally try to remove any unnecessary frequency but i'm still learning at using a fully parametric visual eq effectively appreciate any suggestion or input thanks,0
diy dsp like soundgrid the idea of having a dedicated server to handle my plug in seems really great but soundgrid is a commitment that i m not ready to make i m curious if it s possible to run a rig similar to this where my plug in can be processed on another device that s linked to my host computer via ethernet i m sure it s a long shot but if it s possible i m down for the challenge,0

some question before i start mixing my band's somewhat dense post rock ish ep i'm about to start mixing my new band 's new music and thought i 'd spew some question to hopefully guide me well i've always mixed my band and always thought they turned out pretty decent but could be better any general tip on semi dense music containing section with 3 reverb/delay laden guitar all double mic 'd an sm57 and a fathead sometimes a more rhythmic part along with a lead sometimes just 2 or 3 riffy/arpeggio'd part sometimes two rhythmic part with kind of alternating high note so the rhythm s contain the lead basically tip on parsing thing like that and placing them well and all that more specific question i see often people saying to mix in mono to place everything in the right spot frequency wise that make sense but i feel like multiple guitar part require panning i mean you don 't often cut frequency in one guitar to make room for another do you or do you and either way is mixing in mono to start with a universally agreed upon method or are there downside should i do it with all the non guitar instrument and carve out a spot for all the guitar to live then pan to get the guitar sounding good i've never tried starting in mono we 're using programmed drum with superior drummer i think i've got them sounding pretty natural by sending them all to the same reverb and with superior drummer 's humanizing stuff but any other tip for making unreal drum sound real other than the programming itself i feel like in more emotional le steady and rocking music the kick should be more felt than heard is this a common belief whenever i can hear the click really clearly in post rock music it feel weird am i alone in that any tip for mixing kick if you were to approach mixing a band like explosion in the sky but with vocal what would you do with the vocal to still make them clear while also not detracting too much from the music i've seen band go to both extreme like appleseed cast had an album where the vocal were heavily effected and foxing had an album where the vocal were up front and clear maybe somewhere in between what do you think my band have always suffered from being music for musician and i 'm trying to change that with this one by making it a little more accessible in the mix to me that mean clearer and more up front vocal but i do want the musical subtlety and stuff to come through since that really is our focus i don 't know if this break rule 4 hopefully not since i asked a lot of specific question but here 's a rough mix of one of our song to give an idea of our style any general thought on what you 'd do different would be great i have plenty of issue with this mix sibilance drum and just a bunch of tweak i 'd make but would love to hear your thought a i think a lot of mixing advice is geared towards making like rock music and i don 't feel like that 's really what we are http //shapesinthewater bandcamp com/track/gold http //shapesinthewater bandcamp com/track/gold thanks,0

missing 10k in my mix i wa comparing a mix of mine to a commercial release by lufs matching the two track and then comparing key frequency band i found that all frequency band were within / 2db of the commercial release except for the 10k range which wa much quieter in my mix than in the commercial release are there any very common reason for this to occur my best guess are 1 the commercial release had somewhat more electronic instrumentation would the overtone of these instrument reach higher than other non electronic instrument 2 the commercial release wa a lossy format while my mix wa a wav file could the lossy format add information distortion in the 10k range 3 are commercial mix often given a big 10k eq boost on the mix bus 4 with regard to frequency greater than 10khz am i just generally stupid and deficient,0

how much soundproofing do you actually need for vocal i've been looking at option for soundproofing creating a small booth putting huge blanket all over the place but it all seems a bit overkill for what i actually need it for it's only for vocal i live in a terrace house and the wall are kinda thin so it make me really self conscious about singing loud so it limit my range i've even thought about making a small soundproof box to put over my head a ridiculous a it sound at least it would get the job done and it would probably be cheap to make though i'm sure there would be issue with comb filtering and airflow i bet so how much soundproofing do you even need for a voice to stop it travelling through the wall,0
possibly the dumbest question ever posted here but how do you get a reference track okay so before you laugh to hard all of the music i have is either streaming or from itunes streaming obviously come across in low quality and i cant set it in my project purchase from itunes do not give you 24bit wave file which honestly i do not know if that is necessary or not i could pull a song off youtube but again low quality so where do i get reference track and what quality / file format is necessary for it to be a good reference,0
question about phase i understand the importance of making sure mics are in phase during both recording and mixing but when working itb is there any reason you can't just zoom in on the waveform and line up peak with peaks/troughs with trough visually i see a lot of dude using plugins like sound radix auto align for lining up polarity but it seems like an unnecessary gadget when you can just get different source in phase by referencing sharp transient across several track i e a rimshot on the snare i did this on a project recently and really beefed up a snare in a way that simply flipping the polarity couldn't accomplish any input or just general phase discussion much appreciated,0

old firewire equipment to thunderbolt hey all i have an old presonus firestudio project device that output with ieee 1394 i cannot figure out a way to adapt it to usbc thunderbolt or usb3 any idea on adapter if i did find a way to adapt would it likely be buggy or have a loss in quality i might just have to get new equipment but it stink because the old equipment worked great and suited my purpose thanks for any insight,0
wave free mixing course with dave darlington / reference track question just found this sub today and i m glad because i really want to become the best audio producer/mixer guy i possibly can i ve been self producing/mixing a record for 9 month ive done several record in the past ten year but this is the most seriously i ve ever taken it i am of course also the artist and the writer and blah blah we are in the age of many hat wondering if anyone ha watched this wave series i ve found it extremely useful not always gonna have all the plugins mentioned but just watching pro go at it and talk about their process and why they make their choice is really cool i m not done watching them really but one question that really stand out to me is this when using a reference track wouldn t that track already be mastered how is it helpful to reference a fully mastered track with a track that s in the mix phase like it feel like using a mainstream released track for reference when mastering make sense but how are we supposed to get hold of the mix,0
power adapter question for audio interface i just bought an old used scarlett 18i6 and it didn t include the power adapter i plugged in a 12v adapter rated for 350ma and all i saw in the mixcontrol software wa a full meter of static on every analog channel it s asking for 12v 1a so i assume that the static wa a result of under powering the device my local best buy sell an ac dc adapter variable voltage up to 12v and rated for 1 3a will this power adapter work for my interface i assume that even though it s rated for 1 3a the interface will only draw a much current a it need is there a flaw in my logic here also do you think i m correct in my theory that the static on every channel is due to under powering the interface the seller said that it wa fully functional and he had a number of good review thanks update 12v 1a power supply worked great thankfully it look like under powering via current didn't do any damage i ended up grabbing the variable voltage power supply just for the sake of having a spare around and am planning to order one specifically for the 18i6,0

audio interface routing software is there a universal type of software that make it easy to route thing to and from the ins/outs of an interface i have a behringer interface umc204 that work fine but it doesn t seem to have any support for software like i see people using with focusrite and other brand i m considering getting a bigger interface but i want to get one that is able to configure input and out put the way i want is this just a cost saving thing for behringer and other brand have always had it do i even need it using reaper if that help,0
how do you personally use track sends in a daw are the typical dual send knob per track in daw an obsolete artifact from analog day or am i missing out by not using them i don't use them when i want reverb on a track i add it to that track and tailor it for that track same with any other audio effect i get how they are essential on analog when i have only limited hardware but a software effect can be multiplied almost indefinitely so we don't need to share one effect configuration between multiple track so is the way they are incorporated into daw vestigial or is there still importance behind shared effect over individual is there a way i could be effectually using the sends can having the same effect on multiple track somehow pull a song together in some way or is it simply just for the convenience of well i always set my whatever effect the same no matter what so might a well just do it once edit whoa glad i asked i'm learning a lot thanks for the info,0

loud but not crushing transient hey everyone been producing electronic music for 4 year now ive read a lot on trying to get a loud master ive picked up a few thing such a a loud master depends on a really good mixdown etc while all this is good i still am not able to get the loudness i would like i listen to some of these guy track and am blown away at how loud they can push their track without clipping their drum transient and squashing the absolute life out of their track i guess my biggest question is how do i get my master loud but to where the drum are still clear and aren't crushed to death ill post some track below for reference im sorry i know this question ha been answered probably a thousand time i just can't find anything that ha really stuck with me over the year appreciate any reply http //soundcloud com/mvrdauk/break and fall 1 15 super tight kick and punchy snare anytime i try and make my drum sound like that then try and get loud on the master it fucking ruin them and drastically alters the sound http //soundcloud com/mvrdauk/frontline 54 second http //soundcloud com/theofficialtrilla/playcard black ops xl 56 second,0
frequency to avoid on iphone i ve been referencing a track i made on various device and it sound pretty good everywhere apart from my iphone the kick in particular almost ha a clipping sound when played out of the phone speaker on the ipad it sound fine and also fine on headphone and my monitor just on the phone anyone had this before it s kinda buggin me and i m not sure if it s my mix or the phone not handling a certain frequency to good,0
are behringer product that bad i feel like having behringer product is kind of a taboo in live mixing not sure if it applies to studio work at my school we have a x32 and it work the build quality is bad imo we almost destroyed some input because the connector are bad software isn't that great they did improve it though but it work it doe the audio processing and sends it out now in the end we all want to work with the best stuff available out there problem will always be budget if my school had unlimited money we would be working with grandma's and stuff but they don't so for someone with a tight budget behringer doe a really good job at keeping price low while deliviering decent/good product how are your opinion about this what is the problem with having behringer product,0
cut eq gt compression gt boost eq i've been getting into the technique of cutting the frequency you dont want before you compress and then boost after compression let's say you're working on a snare drum cut eq you high pas around 100 hz and cut 500 hz at 3 db you now throw in your compressor set your attack release etc boost eq now in come your 2nd eq for boosting boost 180 hz and 2500 hz my question is if your 2nd eq is meant for boosting and the cutting portion wa done by the first eq before compression won't all the cutting be reintroduced since those frequency were left alone in that 2nd eq,0
best engineered song of all time hey guy obviously this question is opinion but i like opinion i'm curious to hear what your favorite mix and mastered song or song of all time are or it could even be instrument vocal synths and how much you like it's mix eq reverb etc for instance my favorite snare sound at the top of my list is in one headlight by the wallflower this should be a pretty amazing response doesn't matter the genre whatever drop your jaw i want to hear about it edit i'm loving these response i listen to pretty much every genre of music and seeing the diverse response just prof that music in itself is an amazing force keep the response coming i'm going to listen to every single recommendation thanks guy,0
i really wish i could re mix and re master metallica's death magnetic album no master no mix the full untouched recording that would be the pinnacle of a mixing project to me i've been a long time metallica fan and they've influenced a lot of my rock side it's why i started playing guitar 20 year ago that album wa so well written but so poorly mixed and mastered i wish i could get my hand on it i'm drooling just thinking about it,0
how important is your initial balance to your mixing process when do you start referencing to other mix you admire when mixing the initial balance seems to be nearly the most important thing which determines the quality of your final mix it seems to me that eq compression reverb and effect are just tool to make that balance shine even more you want to use those thing to bring out the character of the part and remove clutter is this how you view the balance stage at what point do you check your mix against others while balancing or when you're closer to being done thanks,0

monitoring problem i am mixing using yamaha hs7s the problem i'm having is that i get the mix sounding good in the monitoring environment but when i take the mix to my hi fi it is far too bass heavy i have to work on the mix and then reference on the hi fi only to find that there are still too many bassy undertone i'm mixing a jazz quartet and the problem is the upright bass it wa recorded with both a bridge mic and a di both have 50hz high pas filter on them and are peaking at about 18 on the faders but it still sound too much through hi fi and even my pc speaker any idea it's a real pain to go through the rigmarole of exporting uploading to soundcloud and playing through my different speaker only to find my monitor aren't giving me an accurate bass reading are my hi fi speaker too bass heavy or something,0
using both my interface card and my on board sound card hey pal i am a noob audio lover who ha recently purchased a pair of presonus eris 3 5 along with the newest presonus studiо 2/4 interface i have started playing my music through the interface a my main card however i have a standard 3 5mm microphone that i cannot plug into my interface since the interface only ha combo trs 1/4 inch input my question is is it possible to still run the microphone through my on board default sound card and run my monitor through my interface i apologize for my lack of understanding in the field of audio engineering i am just starting i have a lot to learn i am on window,0
should i go down to 44 1 when i ve been doing 88 2 or 96 in another thread on here i wa completely surprised to see that the consensus wa that tracking at 44 1k wa the norm at the studio i ve been recording at they d never be caught dead tracking at anything below 96k i often do 88 2 and always 24 bit depth my project eat up space fast and it would be nice to have smaller file size also my computer can handle it better when the project aren t so data heavy can 44 1k sound great then i ve been lectured by my producer many time about why 96k is the best and how like plugins mixing mastering want better data i guess and then you shrink it down for the consumer kind of like shooting in 4k but releasing a video in hd is there a flaw to my logic there,0

having issue with a producer tl dr our producer's not what i expected and there's tension in the band/studio that may necessitate change two year ago my band started production of our first full length album with a guy who wa just putting his foot in the door with owning his own studio he didn't have the capability to record live drum and didn't have the confidence to record live bass and so programmed both he didn't think our lead guitarist picked hard enough and re did his rhythm part wrong in a few spot on his own rather than work it out with the guy who wrote them he's seen u live a few time and know what we sound like a a band but that sound didn't make it through production well we finally got around to starting on the next album about two month ago and the rest of the band agreed to keep working with the same guy by now he's in a new building ha a good drum room and feel confident enough to work with low end but i'm not sure we're well off most band in our genre program drum we have one hell of a good drummer who's actually played on only one or two track in the past 10 year he's been in the scene maybe more and ha almost nothing to show for his effort i'm not convinced the rest of the guy see the need to have him on the record and it's clear a day our producer's too saturated in our scene culture push anything on the first day of recording he apparently told our new rhythm guitarist that he's too good to re record so he's probably still not interested in recording u like we're paying him to then come day three a we're working out some song structure i look over his screen and see he's recording at 44 1khz now i trust my own ear and the relief of peace of mind over any science and wouldn't dare track anything under 24/48 and mention this to him he refutes with something about how 48khz take up too much space/processing power or what not nothing close to a realistic excuse to me but i thought we wound up having a civil discussion about it all he came across a calm and collected maybe a little proud or amused but everyone else in the room got a bit alarmed telling me not to pick fight with the producer and i remember being taken out to the balcony for a cig and to cool down or whatever they thought i needed i came out of it thinking if this is how we butt head we're gonna get along great again it wa a civil conversation i don't know what everyone else could have possibly heard to think otherwise but maybe i shouldn't have been so optimistic he's apparently been open with others in the band about how whatever i said pissed him off they're all convinced i don't know where i stand in his eye but with the lack of communication here plus everything that went wrong with the last album i reeallly do not want to continue with him the last time i recorded with other people wa basically just two or three noobs yelling and poking fun at each other until we got a good mix that somehow worked this is making me fucking nervous right now i'm half afraid to give input for my own album maybe it's my anxiety but something about the guys' disposition isn't giving me warm fuzzies about our upcoming session,0

drum kit saturation by track whole kit or both yes i know that it depends i'm looking for a rule of thumb how should saturation be approached for multi track percussion yes the kick will likely be saturated but then you go hey saturation sound good on the hi hat too etcetera because saturation make everything sound better and that can't be the proper way to decide to use it or not so if you're saturating many track of a drumkit individually would it not be better to saturate the bus for the entire kit instead or is the thinking that each track will generally need a different amount of compression is stacking by track saturation with global saturation feasible or overkill,0

audio end up sounding quiet and slightly lacking in presence anything i can do so i do gaming video on youtube and something i've been trying to figure out is my audio i've never been great at understanding audio and how to make it sound good now my audio is actually fine technically or rather it's not bad i'm just a bit nitpicky and i'm trying to see if there's any tweak i can make to make it sound better i'm not even really sure how to describe what bug me about my audio the best way i can put it is when i watch a video or stream of someone else their audio sound a though they're right there in the room with me yet when i watch my own video back it sound like i'm watching a video doe that make sense it's not bad but it's just slightly off it also sound a touch quieter than a typical pro yt video which i don't understand my process for recording and processing my audio is a follows i record in ob with the commentary audio on a separate track i use ob filter for noise suppression and noise gate and i also use a compressor filter with the following setting ratio x 1 3 threshold db 30 attack m 1 release m 60 i import the audio into audacity and use equalization to boost the bass and treble i use the hard limiter to even out the audio a bit then normalize to 1 and use noise removal to clean up any extra background noise/ frequency i export the audio a a wav file with whatever the default setting audacity us for that i edit my video in premiere element and when i export them out to a final video it us 320kbps aac audio the audio format option are either aac dolby digital or mpeg i record in a small room and while i don't have any kind of noise proof padding i've seen other channel that record in a similar type of room that still sound better than mine is there anything in there that could be tweaked to help me out i really don't know what to tweak or how to tweak it someone suggested i ditch the noise suppressor in ob and i tried that but i don't hear any noticeable difference other than a more noticeable hissing frequency i wa wondering if perhaps the compressor is what's causing my issue but i also like the idea of a compressor a to my understanding it help to keep the audio relatively consistent throughout which is nice because i sometimes get really quiet and really loud at random interval do bigger yters/ streamer not use compressor is that not actually a thing again i realize it's not a big deal like i'm making it sound if there's nothing i can do it is what it is and again my audio isn't exactly bad i just find myself extremely curious about how to improve my quality,0

stereo/mono/phase invert and for mixing mastering for vinyl i am very much a beginner at mixing and mastering but i am working on master for vinyl for want of money not lack of faith in professional engineer and am trying to reduce stereo low end on a mix i think i am doing okay because when i test the mix in mono mode the low end of bass and drum doesn't move at all just seems like some of the high end on synths and shaker etc are spread out a bit more in stereo v mono when i do phase invert on either l or r not much change when i do a mono phase invert on either channel the low end and bass and drum mostly disappears which i'm taking to mean that if you isolate far l or r there's only high end information there which would be good for vinyl because you don't wan't low frequency on the wide end of the stereo field or it will cause skip am i right about this or should you be able to still hear low end in that phase invert mono monitoring thanks in advance for anybody that take time to answer this edit thanks all so much for your advice so helpful also i should clarify to address some other concern that were raised i am in contact with the cutting engineer and i'm at this stage because my first set of master had too much stereo bass information so i'll get feedback on the next pas also yes doing reference lacquer,0
question regarding conflicting guideline in acx submission guideline regarding sound level i'm looking to start recording audiobooks for my novel i'm intending to use the acx platform audible but a couple of their submission guideline have me a little perplexed one guideline read a follows gt each file must measure between 23db and 18db rms gt put simply all file must fall within a specific volume range by keeping all file within this range not too loud and not too soft listener won't have to constantly adjust the volume of their playback device but the next guideline read gt each file must have peak value no higher than 3db gt by leaving this headroom you'll reduce the possibility of distortion which can reduce the quality of the listening experience this headroom is also needed to ensure file are successfully encoded these two seem contradictory to me a the first one seems to say that there can't be any sound higher than 18db but the second suggests that there can be sound up to 3db i'm very new to audio recording so perhaps that's why i'm confused but if anybody can point out something i'm missing i would be greatly appreciative thank you,0
the importance of a consistent workflow or presets work too i guess i'm in the mildly agonizing process of mixing my next release and ran into a major facepalm moment today one song ha been irritating me for week because it wa coming off extremely muddy and i had no idea why it's an instrumental tune and i di everything so there's no way it wa room noise or anything i messed with eq on every instrument at least 10 time and couldn't get it to sit right i gave up and decided to come back later always good advice another song wa coming across way too sterile and didn't have enough punch i had the brilliant realization that i probably needed to adjust the high pas on the reverb i decided to cross reference the reverb's high pas on the other song to try to unify them a bit more i go back to the instrumental track to check on the reverb and never did it that would certainly explain the mud needle to say i now have a preset on both my eq plugin and reverb so that doesn't happen again literally hour of agony because i'm a total idiot and while i wa typing this i went back to inspect some vocal that were misbehaving i went to adjust the deesser and naturally i never set that up either please send help,0
anyone else using auto tune pro or other antares software i ve always been a huge fan of antares software because also being heavily interested in computer i ve always been fascinated by the algorithm that must work behind their plugins especially auto tune i also found a bug one time in one of the minor release of auto tune 7 and emailed them about it and one of the developer actually called me to talk about it while i helped him reproduce it on his machine so they could fix it in the next release that wa really cool being a programmer and being a teenager at the time knowing that i wa the reason a bug in a piece of software used in thousand of major studio around the world got fixed with the next update haha anyways i ve been using auto tune since i purchased the boxed version of auto tune evo several year ago and i ve purchased every single update since so a soon a auto tune pro came out i bought the update and i ve been using it for several month i really like the new ui design and i think it wa a well needed refresh however when it come to actually working with it i m really disappointed it s buggy a hell first off when they first released version 9 0 0 there wa a bug where the update window would pop up every single time you d open up the plugin telling you that an update wa available to version 9 0 0 even though that wa the version you were running antares quickly pushed out 9 0 1 within a matter of day a release specifically to address this bug but what concern me is exactly how did the developer manage to miss that how do you miss a bug that obvious that occurs every single time the plugin is opened secondly it s super unstable it seems to be better in automatic mode but in graphical mode it randomly crash logic pro quite frequently like every 5 minute i thought maybe it wa an issue with logic so i tried it in reaper instead and same thing lastly there are just random minor bug throughout for example in graphical mode the adjust vibrato knob literally doe nothing on line object i thought maybe this wa just missing functionality for line object but according to the manual it should sometimes the cursor in graphical mode also randomly jump while you re drawing an object which is really annoying i don t know i feel like antares ha really dropped the ball with this one and i m kind of disappointed especially since i ve been a loyal customer of their s for year it almost seems like auto tune pro wa hyped up by antares at all these producer and audio engineering conference just to be rushed to release long before it had gone through proper testing for bug and stability i think i m going to switch back to 8 1 for now until they release the next patch because sonically the two release are supposedly the same but who know when the next patch for auto tune pro will be we ve already been stuck with version 9 0 1 for about half a year when i m sure i can t be the only one that ha noticed these bug thought,0

between the line 5 the real world hello all today's post come to you from a 600 seat concert hall in upstate ny the hall wa originally constructed for acoustic performance and a such is far more reverberant than we'd like for reinforced music the seating is covered by what some of my system tech buddy jokingly call a dash array that is a 'line array' that's too short to exhibit any meaningful line source behavior at any frequency specifically four box per side which is barely enough to cover the seating area what's more they're all driven off a single dsp channel per side so optimization option are few since this is the type of situation that we are very likely to encounter often in the real world i thought it might be illustrative to show what should be done in this situation v what can be done here http //imgur com/lnmdewq we see the house left array response over the seating area with mic position at the onax of each box in the array here is an alternate view http //imgur com/uddmc3h of the same data with 1/12 oct smoothing thicker trace and the coherence trace visible for position onax a top box back row the subwoofer is muted a lot of working with an analyzer is displaying the data in a format that's comfortable for you to parse and understand i tend to prefer le smoothing and thin trace but when writing or presenting i use more smoothing and thicker trace just to make the trend a little easier to see for people who may not spend all day staring at analyzer edit this comment http //www reddit com/r/livesound/comments/a6rkp9/between_the_lines_5_the_real_world/ebz9exb about using trace averaging is very important here i'm not looking for trend i'm looking to see the difference over the space trace averaging would completely hide the issue that is the basis of work in this post it's a video solution to an audio problem i don't want to make the trace look better otherwise i'd use photoshop i want to solve the problem that make them look that way the pink trace onax a is below the level of the others from 250 on up and much lower above 6k3 or so this coupled with the relatively low coherence from being that far back in a reflective room translates to poor intelligibility for the folk in the furthest seat who need it most what are the textbook solution solution 1 more box this is out at least without a lot of budget and advanced notice it's a permanent install and the rigging is a deadhang so we can't easily bring the array in we'd need to bring in motor and a rigger solution 2 close up the angle between the top few box besides the same logistical issue can't bring the array down can't pull pin out from a lift with the array hanging we're out of coverage angle the bottom two box are already at maximum splay so by closing up the top we'll be creating a coverage issue at the bottom perhaps this is preferable because front fill could be added but they can't stay on the deck so for most event they won't be added because people are lazy and so we still haven't solved the problem a an added bonus this particular model of box ha particularly course option for splay angle and the next choice is too narrow for this application solution 3 dsp tweak the gain and hf shelf on the top box except we can't because we're all on one channel here or can we these active box have a pot on the back that set the input level to the internal amp we can tweak that to get some gain back there's also a per box option for hf compensation and we can try our luck with that to see if we can get an hf shelf boost out of it a soon a we talk about level shading array audio people get really nervous the first issue is that once the array is level shaded some box are going to go into limiting before others whether or not this is a problem is heavily dependent on the situation typical shading situation involve bringing the bottom few box down by a few db to reduce the extra hf down front we try to do a much a we can with splay but generally we still will need a few db via gain and this isn't really an issue of limiting because these box in being turned down now have more headroom than those pointing at foh so there's no problem it's when the higher gain box are further back in the house like this example that we need to be more careful by setting the gain higher on the top box than for the rest we have a situation where the top box will hit it limter first and the foh engineer down in the middle of the house won't hear it if this is a high spl situation rap rock edm etc where the pa is taken to it limit every night giggity this is probably something we want to avoid however this is a situation that prioritizes low variance and high intelligibility and the pa is not operated anywhere even close to it limit for the type of event staged in this hall people would be lodging loudness complaint it's lot of old people okay far before the pa hit it maximum output so the dynamic range issue isn't a concern whereas creating a low variance high intelligibility environment for the patron is definitely a priority for the venue's management the other more common and far more baseless objection to array shading is that any gain offset between box break the line bob mccarthy ha written what i consider to be a landmark article http //www prosoundweb com/channels/study_hall/breaking_the_line/ about this which outline a number of reason why this concern is unfounded but i'll address the most commonly stated objection here that shading down some box reduces the array's headroom of course this is true but in reality the loss is so tiny that it's negligible in all but the most extreme situation we're talking of course about lf because that's where the box have the most overlap and thus the most summation we have a 4 box array which mean that the lf headroom of the array is 12 db above that of a single box that is 0 db 0 db 0 db 0 db which everyone know is 12 db no here's the same math in linear for for box at unity 1 1 1 1 4 get back to log with 20log 4/1 12 db now let's say we turned one box down by 2 db how much lf coupling do we lose 2 db is about 8 in linear you've got these memorized right http //gph is/1tqiicg so we now have 0 db 0 db 0 db 2 db which in linear is 1 1 1 0 8 3 8 that come out to 11 6 db rather than 12 20log3 8 11 6 or use 20log 3 8/4 to get the db loss in relative term a compared to the no shading situation in a situation that demand low variance a half a db in lf headroom is a small price to pay for reducing front back variance by 2 db for the same reason i'm not concerned about goosing the top box by a db or two also for the same reason bringing up the gain on the top box or down on the rest if you like isn't going to cause a significant effect at lf where all the box are working together it will however help increasingly above 1k which is where our problem is with one pot notch whatever that is of gain and the hf coupling compensation onboard dsp filter engaged here's what we get http //imgur com/ebkq5qd http //imgur com/ebkq5qd if you compare that to the first image http //imgur com/lnmdewq you can see that we actually overshot a bit the back seat are leading the rest of the array in the hf by about 3 db above 1 khz given those two option i certainly choose the latter the intelligibility in the rear is greatly improved over the original state in addition i'll take an extra db or two in the back simply because of the stage sound down front what we have here is a pa that doe not get louder a you get closer to it and a high degree of confidence that whatever the foh engineer mix will be heard in all the seat which those with touring experience can confirm is a relative rarity in venue of this size even with limited option on the table a small change here and there go a long way a always comment question and alternate approach are welcomed wishing you all a wonderful

why buy expensive stuff recently i wa having a whimsical what would you do with a million dollar conversation with my wife we allowed ourselves several different situation and in one of mine i said i would use the bulk of it to buy equipment and hire staff for a touring company her response wa essentially why would you need 800k to do that couldn't you do it for way le i explained that even though it seems like a lot that much money go very quickly when starting a new business and building a decent size rig from scratch she wa still skeptical i'm having a hard time coming up with way to explain the scope of a medium to large touring company and rig how would you explain production and equipment cost to a layperson do you feel that high end equipment is inflated in price or worth every penny,1

question when a lot of singer are on stage with multiple voice on part do you have all bgvs turned up equally i know this is a bit of a loaded question so i will try to be a clear a possible we usually have about 5 6 singer with mics on stage usually with 1 or 2 harmony accompanying the melody at most our total ensemble is large usually 3 4 guitarist 2 keyboardist drummer bassist and percussionist in addition to the vocal team we usually have a different singer lead each song and are trying to determine how to utilize the other singer in the best way when i listen or watch live recording with numerous singer it seems i can only pick out 2 3 voice even though more are on stage i wonder if some more professional production mute or turn down mics to keep the mix cleaner thought,1

community theater rig looking for idea i've put together a small rig for the community theater here and am looking for idea on way to improve it 1 x air xr18 2 7x shure dual wireless mic pack 3 driverack 360 with rta mic 4 laptop usually my macbook air soon to add a pc for others to use 5 scarlett 2i2 usb dac normally stolen from my desk 6 stream deck surprisingly awesome for show 7 in the main venue i've added some shure hanging lav 8 my spare mixer bheringer x1222usb 9 wireless router since the x air built in is a bit lame 10 x touch 11 fire 10 tablet fire 7 tablet phone whatever is handy to run around the theater with the 10 is my goto for tuning 12 led strip light with a dimmer on a 1x2 that i run across the entire sound table gooseneck be gone 13 usually yamaha dbr12s for stage monitor small bheringer for backstage monitor the x air is a great rig but i have to admit that i'm considering getting them an x32 when i spec'd the 18 i never envisioned needing 14 friggin wireless mics they still end up swapping pack around so a surprise entry here is the stream deck i honestly bought this on a whim for my gaming rig helping out for one show i brought it along it turn out that the thing is fantastic for audio cue i'm even tempted to run one over to the director so they can kick off sound effect each clip is assigned a button and you can quickly build multiple screen for the last show there were 45 audio cue we were able to nail them all easily with the stream deck the hanging lav have saved u more time than i can count unfortunately there's a projector setup in center stage and i can't hang mics there i have mics mixer and driverack mounted in an odyssey fz1004 10u/4u slant case it's really heavy despite being loaded with relatively lightweight gear and a pair of furman power strip to plug everything in is there a good lightweight option setup is much easier despite the weight usually it's just a matter of hijacking some cable to run monitor/stage feed i use the house wiring and coupler to reverse the xlr flow and i takeover the master output from the house board the house board ha some issue so i avoid slaving into it anymore thing i'd love suggestion on lightweight rack option the case i've been using is a bit painful to haul around i may just put caster on it and call it a day good way to extend the x touch for live show the slider are great but without some midi software control the button on the right are just pretty light it seems that i can dual use it a x air control and then pull midi data via the usb interface at the same time good way to general mic center stage i've considered 1 2 crown pcc 160s or maybe some stand mounted 'choir' mics aka lav on a stick the idea is to get a bit more pickup for small role or help out when main character have mic issue,1
