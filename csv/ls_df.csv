Help With Midi,"Hi there. I'm planning to use multiple midi controllers with MainStage running through my MacBook.

Best Mic for Quiet Vocalist?,"Hey everyone, i'm wondering what mics have worked best for a quiet vocalist in a loud band. The singer in my band has a very soft voice with a lot of reverb on it. We recently switched her to a IEM setup which has helped a ton with stage feedback issues. The issue we are facing now is cymbal bleed into the mic. We are mostly playing small club size stages so regardless of the vocal placement it's always relatively close to the drums. Our tech last night said that the vocal reverb was hitting the drums super hard and also the drums were bleeding into the IEM mix a lot.  


I know some sort of hyper cardioid pickup mic would work best but i'm wondering what experience people have with each one. We have used a Beta 57 time to time but have found the output too hot and highs a little harsh.

IEMs with Orchestra,"Hey all,

Got a show coming up where I'll be doing some IEM work for a few performers who are being accompanied by a small orchestra and choir. There will be main orchestra mic arrays (probably spaced pair and some outriggers), and spot mics buried within the orchestra.

Usually for orchestral mixes I will delay spot mics to the main array. I'm concerned this technique won't translate to IEMs because of the positioning of the performers with IEMs (likely somewhere nestled around/in the orchestra/choir), and the potential for the performer's voice/instrument to bleed into the spot mics that are close to them. These performers also have a tendency to only wear one ear of their IEM as well. 


How would you monitor engineers attack this? Ditch trying to use the orchestral spot mics at all? Use them but with no delay? Ditch trying to incorporate the main array? ",t2_6cbc7,1,1

Router recommendation for XR18,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am am music teacher at an elementary school and we put on musicals each year. As the main sound person, I've been slowly improving our sound situation and at the recommendation of some sound tech friends (and due to budget), I went with the XR18. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight was the first show for parents. All week it had been working fine, though like an idiot I was just connected directly to the unit without a router. And of course, like all the posts and reviews say, tonight about 10 minutes after opening house and the room filling up, connection was lost. Even standing right next to it we couldn't get connected. Not with PC or ipad. Had to scramble but made things work. We have our second show tomorrow night. 

&amp;#x200B;

So tomorrow I get to buy what I need for the show that night. Can you guys tell me of some appropriate routers I can get at my local Best Buy that will work fine in a cafeteria of 300 people.  Hopefully not break the bank too much but PTA should reimburse me some. I'm also an idiot and couldn't get it hard wired, but if getting 200 ft of cat-5 or cat-6 will be a good backup plan I will do that as well.

  
Thank you, and I'm sorry and embarrassed for not following advice I've previously read. I appreciate anything you can offer. ",t2_9nbwt,6,1

Looking for advice on a setup for a live perfomance in a not so great environment,"Hey guys!

&amp;#x200B;

I was tasked with setting up the gear for a live gig my band is going to do. 

The problem is that we're gonna play in the front of one of our friend's house, in a little recess in front of the garage door.

Our band has three vocals (one main, two backing), eletric guitar and keys (or two guitars, the keyboardist plays rhythm guitar in a couple of songs), bass and drums. 

We have three 150w PA's (connect to the mixer), two 100w guitar amps (both with stands) and one 80w bass amp.

Even though we will have the walls on the sides and back, I'm worried that the open sky and also the front will make everything sound thin and small.

How can I setup this gear so we can have the most presence and compete with the cars passing on the street?

Weird Freespeak II beltpack issue,"I'm currently A2-ing a show right now: I have 7 beltpacks and 1 freespeak II base station. Everything has been working as it should, except I had one beltpack that I could assign roles, but audio would not pass through the headset, no talk, no listen. I could call the channels, and receive calls, but no audio . I changed headsets with a known working set and still no audio.

I went into the menus on a working beltpack and found that the Auto Detect function was off. Changing this to off on the non working beltpack (it was ON) fixed the issue. Turning Auto Detect on my working pack to ON, and then cycling the power, made the belt pack not pass audio.

Has anyone encountered this?! I called tech support to ask about it, thinking there was a way to factory reset the beltpack, but was told that it could not be done, and that the beltpack receives all of its information from the ROLE. But upon looking at the role, there is no selection for Auto Detect.",t2_kqwfn,3,1

How do I practice?,"I've been fortunate in the past to work with a band that had a kick ass practice space where I could do a full show setup using all the equipment we'd usually use at shows, but due to ""issues"" we've had to move to a much smaller shared space. In this space, the band I work with isn't the main band using the place, so I'm unable to use our normal setup or board, or make any major changes to the board or PA.  It's an older analog board, so I don't have the benefit of scenes or anything. We basically only run vocals through it.

The old setup allowed me to play around with the board and try things without the risk of ruining a live show. I learn best by actually putting my fingers on knobs and sliders, so this is pretty important to me. Ever since moving to the new studio I feel like my skills have stagnated. 

I'm pretty green, but I'm at the point where I can consistently get sound that's ""non broken"" (can hear everyone, no/little feedback etc) but I know I can get things to sound a lot better.  

I also have several live shows recorded. Unfortunately, theres not a lot I can do with those other than loading them up in a DAW and trying to get a good mix out of them. That's valuable for playing with things like EQ, compression, effects etc, but not really comparable to a live show.

What else should I be looking at practice-wise? I suspect I was spoiled before with our old setup. I really wish I had tried more things while we were still there.

Speaker recommendations for a jazz venue,"Hey all, looking for some recommendations for a PA system for the venue I manage.

We're a 1200sq ft, [extremely oddly shaped room](https://imgur.com/a/nJSbFML). Our venue exclusively presents jazz, mostly modern stuff. Since the room is small enough, the acoustic level of the drums really dictates what we throw in the PA, which is usually piano and voice, and occasionally horns that aren't way too loud. Our room is sort of treated so there isn't stuff bouncing around all over the place, but definitely still a live + kind of boomy room. 

Our current system is a pair of Mackie SA1530z. The issue I encounter is how the sound of the room changes based on where you're sitting. In the middle area of the room, up to where the mixer is, there's a raised roof that goes up about 24 feet. The room is at it's regular height at the stage and behind the mixer, which is 14 feet. As you might guess, the change in roof size affect the sound and things sound different on stage, vs right in front of the stage, vs, all the way behind the mixer. Additionally, the room also gets tinier (as in like an L shape), so you really don't get much of the stage right speaker in the back of the room. 

My first thought is that the Mackies are raised at the 14 feet height of the ceiling, so hanging at about 11-12 feet, and are pointed straight, which affects the people at the front of the room sitting sort of underneath the speaker, they don't get as much of it as someone sitting in the back. As I mentioned, the room is treated, but the shape of the room is really hard to fight so there's only so much the treatment can do for us. So for now I'd like to solve the speaker issue and see if there's any better options available. For a 1200sq ft room, two 1300watt speakers are a bit much, I think, although I can't seem to find anything smaller than that that is also 3-way. 

So my first question/assumption is, changing the way my current Mackies are mounted, by aiming them a bit more down, would that help the distribution of sound?

My second question is, are there any speakers that may be better suited for the job? For a second I was thinking about doing a faux-vertical array with 4 speakers, 2 on each side, one pair pointing straight ahead and one pair pointing down more, but maybe there's a single pair of speakers that may do the trick without having to work on an array. I should mention my budget for this is ~$2000 (hopefully less).

Obviously changing the mounting on my current speakers would be the cheapest option, probably not running me any more than $1000 for the parts and labor, but speakers I've been looking at have been $1000+ each. 

Hope to hear some good suggestions, and thanks in advance.",t2_lh38z,1,1

MR18 vs X32R,"Hi All,
I've searched through almost all discussion on the MR18, X32R, and the closely related XR18 on this sub--but I still have some questions that hopefully you all can help me out with.

I am a hobbyist, and would be looking to only use this mixer for small ensembles (mostly 6-10 vocalists on handhelds) as well as for my primary interface for recording.  

It seems to me like most of the arguments for the X32R are that it is a more effective mixer at adapting to large scale gigs, and interfaces well with the other x32 products.

On the other hand, the MR18 is smaller, and has the midas preamps.  I haven't had the chance to play with either, but I'm under the impression that this would give the MR18 a better sound--is this true?

Are there any other major factors I should consider? Effect/app differences? The two are at a fairly close price point, so I'm just trying to get the most bang for my buck for my use case.

Help/Advice determining if Audio Equipment is ample for Venue.,"Hello.

I am currently organizing a concert event with a semi-notable rapper and am trying to gauge if the audio equipment that is being provided by the production company will be enough for the venue. First, I think it is important to note that the production for the event is being coordinated by the rapper's manager and is being rolled into the overall booking cost of the artist. This leads me to believe that they would be motivated to skimp on production costs and supply subpar equipment, as it would mean more money for them. I have no serious knowledge of audio equipment on this scale, so I am enlisting your help to make an educated decision.

**Venue Details:** We are expecting 1500-2000 people for this event. The performance will take place inside a 2,000 sq ft basement (concrete floor and walls). The basement opens up to a 1-acre outside area. 2 large windows and 2 double doors on the exterior wall will be removed to allow for sight and audibility of the performance to those outside. 

**Production Details (they are valuing at $2500) :**

* Behringer X32 (Quantity: 1)
* Behringer S16 (Quantity: 3)
* Shure ULX-D Wireless (Quantity: 3)
* EV ETX 15P (Mains) (Quantity: 6)
* EV ETX 18SP (Subs) (Quantity: 2)
* QSC HPR 122i DJ Monitor (Quantity: 1)
* Speaker Stand (Quantity: 6)
* Mic Stands (Quantity: 2)
* Audio Cable Kit (Quantity: 1)
* Audio Power Cable Kit (Quantity: 1)
* LABOR: Audio Engineer 1(Quantity: 1)
* LABOR: Stage Hands (Quantity: 2)

**Questions:**

1. Is a value of $2500 fair for this amount of equipment? If not, any suggestions for other production options? (Located in SC)
2. Will this amount of equipment provide ample sound performance, not only inside the basement but to the aprox. 1000 people in the outdoor area? If not, what do I need to ask for to get the performance I am looking for? (Power output is not a problem. We have more than enough.)
3. The absence of lighting equipment is something that is bothering me. If I were to ask for a standard/budget lighting setup for inside the basement, how much should I expect the price to increase?

Thanks in advance for any and all advice on this subject. It is greatly appreciated.",t2_2j0a7p02,24,1

Traditions concerning turning on orchestra mics for tuning,"Folks working with pits/orchestras regularly, is there an established tradition when it comes to turning on the mics in the pit?

Acoustic baffles for misbehaving guitarists?,"Hey guys. Working in small venues as I do, guitar volume is always a problem.

Thoughts on Bose's RoomMatch arrays? Just wrapped our shiny new install,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/2t9B8Hp](https://imgur.com/gallery/2t9B8Hp)

I'm really impressed by this system, and I normally hate Bose Professional PAs. This lineup seems great though, because it's based on physical box design, and maximum number of box angle options, rather than digital steering mojo and time delay magic. Those seems to be bose's traditional marketing tools. But there's nothing magical about the design or function, just flexible designs made possible by the number of options for elements you can choose. We have an odd shaped room, with little floor space, and we were able to cover the entire room, including flying the 2x18 sub, from front row to back of the balcony with a single array, no delay fills, and minimal sound directed outside the seating area. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reflections are much less pronounced, sound is clear and full, very even coverage thanks to the single hang, transition between boxes is smooth, and directional control seems very nicely implemented. The system is much louder in the house than the previous, and still with less spill onto the stage, reducing feedback into choir mics, lectern, etc. ",t2_ky17p,0,1

Is there a mixer with 4-8 channels that has a digital interface with no knobs or hidden knobs so the settings could be locked?  Also, something with auto gain control might be nice for when they crank the computer output to 11. 

Right now this is accessible to a wide range of parent volunteers and high school students. Something with a simple volume control would be best. ",t2_5yv2rzt,1,1

Podcast monitoring,"I hope this is the right place for this...

I have several friends that want to get together on a freeform podcast project and record random crap for two hours or so.  As a proof of concept, we want to try a few of them and see how they are received.  We don't want to invest thousands into a bunch of high-end audio gear (that none of us know how to use) if we don't have to.  I would like some suggestions on how to pull this off given the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1- I plan on capturing a muti-track using Adobe Audition on my macbook pro with 3 to 5 people sitting around just shooting the crap.  I will route all audio through a thuderbolt USB hub.

2- We are going to start with entry level microphones, probably the Audio-Technica AT2005USB.  

3- One of the biggest issues is this: I don't know how to get everyone monitoring the multichannel mix.  I have done some pretty simple google searches, but I am having no luck with it at all.  

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I know that the majority of folks in here are pros and will curse this idea as amateur and not worthy of their time, I am just hoping that someone can give me some direction and advice to make a low budget audio engagement sound decent while allowing everyone to monitor the multichannel mix down in real time so that we are not all stepping on each other during the conversation.

We have a newcomer to our HOW who has a past in brass and percussion performance, but not live mixing. The leadership of the HOW has asked him to select us a replacement for our Mackie ONYX 32.4 console. He's adamant that the QU32 is the best sounding board for under $5000. ***However***, our HOW has the soundboard in a separate room from mains (I wish I had power over this decision), and we'll be largely reliant on mobile apps and laptops from the audience to do most mixing.

&amp;#x200B;

From my searching, the m32 has fantastic support for Win,Mac,Linux,iOS,Android, while the QU32 only supports Apple devices. The newcomer is an Apple user and is ignoring the incumbents (including myself) who do not have supported devices.

* Has a very gracious time in lieu agreement (anything after 8 hours in a day is time in lieu, anything outside 8am-6pm is time in lieu, for every 1 hour worked in time in lieu 1.5 hours are banked, can take time in lieu almost anytime without an approval process, weekends are paid as overtime) 
* Has high creative control over lighting designs for shows and is first pick for all lighting shows 
* He has a pretty high volume of work (but if he ask's for time off i try to give it to him whenever possible)
* Company has pretty high expectations of him (He is our only fulltime 8ton truck driver) 

**What he offers the company (positive and negative)** 

* Very solid and hard worker (with truck license and lifter license) 
* Excellent troubleshooting skills 
* Arguably the best lighting guy in town 
* Using all his time in lieu to work on his own events/ other AV companies. (and its frequent enough that crewing around his away time is becoming difficult) 
* Takes a lot of work from one of our regular clients and does it under his own mini company
* constantly complains about everything the company does (and i mean everything...no matter what i fix there is always something else that is the worst thing ever)
* Convinces other staff to work for him on his events (paying them cash to avoid tax might i add) 

I think that about covers everything that is going on. We had a meeting this morning to tighten up our time in lieu policy and hint out that we dont want him working for the enemy and taking our clients away and he got super shitty about it.

Audio Combiner,"Hey Everybody,

Have any of you ever used a large audio combiner?  I'm working on an installation where all the input channels will be wired to a permanently installed analog split then to a D-rack for FoH audio and a D-Rack for monitors.  I want to add drive lines for touring acts and have the inputs from the stage drive lines hit the same amps as the D-Racks will hit.  My initial thought was a splitter in reverse.  So taking the drive lines from the stage and outputs of D racks in the rack into a combiner that feeds the amps.  Kinda confusing, but it sounds like there are similar things happening in larger venues.  Basically giving the venue the ability to have touring bands bring their own monitor or FoH consoles to use while still having permanently installed consoles.   

I can find a lot of 2 in/1 out combiners, but I was wondering if there was anything that was larger and rack-mountable.  Like 16 in/ 8 out.

The speakers are rated for maximum 80W*4 = 320W, so for brief periods at maximum power, the amplifier should not damage the speakers.  However, I should probably set the amplifier's level to about 50% for continuous use.

The objective is to get some kind of practice holding and performing with mics, practicing blend, but we would also like to take it to gigs. We need 13-14 mics and we would really like for it to be wireless as that allows us to practice choreography for competition. There a few main possibilities that I see: 

 1) Get a full set of good wired mics , thinking the SM58. (14 x ~$100 = $1400 including cables, but not a snake) This will be most beneficial to allowing us to hear ourselves and practice on an actual sounds system, but it doesn’t really let us practice choreo. My thought is that if we are primarily concerned about ICCA practice, it may be better to do what we’ve done in the past and just go practice on someone else’s system. 

2) Get a full set of okayish wireless mics, perhaps the VocoPro UHF-5805 (4 x $350 which is a set of 4 = $1400). So these are lower quality mics, but will still get the job done for right now. These would be very easy to take to gigs because we wouldn’t have to worry about setting up a wired system and a snake. They will still give us significantly better sound than any gig we’ve literally ever performed at. We could definitely use these to practice for ICCA’s and do chores as well, they just won’t give us as professional of a sound.

3) Get some wireless mics of slightly less quality and then two of good quality, thinking the VocoPro UHF-5800 for the less quality and then Sennheiser 825 for the good ones. (3 x $300 set of 4 UHF-5800 and then 1 x $500 set of 2 e825) This set up would allow us to have a fully wireless system which lets us practice ICCA and choreo and stuff, but it also gives good sound quality for the soloist and maybe a bass of VP. This would give great sound quality for gigs, but again might be compromising a bit more in terms of listening to ourselves in rehearsals.

Would LOVE any feedback or any insight on experience with any of these mics.",t2_cb74j,2,1

Was this a bad work environment or am I just too inexperienced?,"I just got finished up at what I consider the first 'real' live sound gig of my career.  Up till now I've just been doing sound at a small church with only four band members.

It's easy to make stories reflect favorably on me, so I'll try to be fair.

First, the facts.

- I was told I would be doing sound for a ten piece band. In reality there were eleven instruments and four of them also sang.

- There were also multiple guest soloists that I didn't know about until they came out to do their song in rehearsal.

- There was a comedic act that came out between songs that I didn't know about *until the first time he came out on stage during performance.*

- There was a guest band of over ten banjo players that I didn't know about until ten minutes before the show started.

- The venue did not have all the equipment necessary for the show and we had to make an emergency trip to a music store for more cables.

- I had to set up the entire system myself (all musicians set up their instruments, amps, etc but nothing beyond that).  This was the first time I had seen this system, and I was the only sound technician there.

- I was also asked to control the lights and a powerpoint minutes before the show started.  This didn't prove too difficult, but it was another responsibility that I was not expecting that would reflect poorly on me if done incorrectly.

- Despite being told to keep wireless mics on all the time, and that the talent would turn them off when off stage, they ended up forgetting more often than not and I ended up babysitting the mute button for those channels the entire night.

Now for some more subjective things:

- Musicians tended to consider everything my fault, even things I had no control over. For instance due to the lack of equipment and hectic setup, some backup vocalists had to share a monitor mix with some other instruments.  When the musicians asked for more of X in the monitor, the vocalists only wanted to hear themselves and I had to tell them it simply wasn't possible to have it both ways.  This put the vocalists in a bad mood for all of rehearsal.

- During rehearsal one musician ran all the way back up the booth to tell me to turn off the mic of one of the vocalists because she sounded bad.  I found this very irregular.

- In general I just felt very out of the loop.  Guest musicians were appearing left and right.  At one point during the performance there was a mini talent show, and I had to scramble to change things around.  Most guest musicians ended up borrowing instruments from regulars or plugging into their amps with their own instruments.

I hope this doesn't come off as too much of a rant. Since this is my first big show, I don't know what's typical and what's not. For what it's worth, the director said I did a fantastic job and wanted to have me work for him again.  I'm not sure if I'm cut out for this though if this is how it really is.  Everything was so hectic, I had to juggle ten things at once, musicians, divas, EQ, even the freaking lights.  I'm exhausted and I still have a two hour drive home.

EDIT: Thanks everyone so much for the advice, stories, and humor.  I survived the whole thing so now parts of it can be funny memories instead of stressful situations. I feel I have a better perspective on the whole thing now and will be better prepared for the next one.

Need Help with Live Audio for Livestream/Recording setup,"Hey r/livesound!

Was hoping that one of you will be able to help me out with an issue that I am frequently coming across with my audio setup for livestreaming and local recording. I want to be able to listen to applications I want, have my stream listen to applications I want, and record the applications I want as seperate audio layers (can be done in OBS). Let me elaborate:

&amp;#x200B;

Currently for my setup I have Discord on one sound device, and Game sounds on another device. This way in OBS I can specify Discord as Audio Track 1, and Game sound as Audio Track 2. If I dont want to stream with discord sounds, then I can have the stream only listen to Track 2, and record Track 1 and 2. The issue here is that because I only have two output devices, all my OTHER sound from my PC goes to the default device, which is the same as the Discord device. This means that I cannot listen to music when streaming, and the stream also cannot listen to music when I am streaming if I choose to not broadcast Discord.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am thinking would be a solution:  
A system where I can set all my applications to certain audio devices (Maybe a soundcard can do this?), have them be routed into a mixer, with 3 outputs (Stream, Recording, and to my headphones (live monitoring would work yes?)) This way I do not have to change around devices on my PC every time I play a new game, or want to have something else being streamed. My worry with this setup would be latency, I play games so lag is important to keep down. I do not know how much latency would be introduced for a setup like this, but would like something very close to zero latency.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

Would a Mixer with multiple inputs (3+) for each of my computer applications, outputting to my Stream, Local Recording, and Myself have little to no latency and solve my issue of only being able to broadcast a max of two applications?

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions of cheap-ish mixers that are capable of solving my issues, or any other method would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I have tried software solutions such as Voicemeeter and Virtual Audio Cable. When I am recording, streaming, and playing a game this system lags out and has even caused me to BSOD a few times because of system instability. (Would have to up the CPU priority of the process in order for the sound to not be laggy, sometimes causing BSOD)",t2_w5872,0,1

Between the Lines #4: Preset vs Reset,"Howdy y'all. Preparing some of the new QSC K.2 series boxes for a club install and have some data here from the verification step of the process. I thought it was interesting enough to share, and there's a couple of things I found thought-provoking, as it's my first time working with this particular product.

These boxes come with onboard DSP that allows HPF, EQ, delay, and eleven preset tunings. Here's a nifty animation showing how each of the presets compares to the raw response. (1/12 oct smoothing)

[https://imgur.com/v74DAw9](https://imgur.com/v74DAw9)

To address the obvious question, no, it's not a flat line. I measured the loudspeaker in the real world, where it's going to be used, not in a lab. Rather than the line itself, what I'm pointing out here is the differences in each of the presets.

I personally find the gain reduction on some of these presets rather alarming. I would have assumed that the tunings simply changed the EQ curves, but a handful of these have pretty severe attenuation as well. I'd be interested to know what the thinking was behind these decisions.

If you're a system tech, you probably are extremely skeptical of tuning presets like these. My view on this is more philosophical than technical:

* If you're a musician, and you just want to plug in and play, use whatever preset you think sounds the best. That's clearly where QSC is going with these presets.
* As an engineer, however, I feel that EQ'ing the entire system for a specific input is a big no-no. Each EQ has a job, and we don't want to get the wires crossed. I use input EQ for inputs. I use loudspeaker EQ to manage the loudspeaker in the space. For more on this approach, see [this article](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/church/eq-boot-camp-a-regimented-approach-to-effective-equalization/) and [this video by Dave Rat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU9BmupC62c). Now, practically, if that's all you have at your disposal, obviously you want to use it, but I try to adhere to strict EQ discipline whenever possible, which keeps things nice and organized, and pays off in spades on larger more complex systems.

The bigger and more practical issue is that I don't want to use a preset unless I understand what it's doing to my signal. This is the big distinction between the artistic and the technical. It's perfectly acceptable in my view for an artist to be ignorant of what's happening under the hood as long as they're getting the desired results. Not so for an engineer.

Another good example of this is an ""Enhancer"" plugin or any sort of ""magic black box"" process. Lots of these exist. They all claim to make it sound ""better"" but don't elaborate on how. If you're a musician and you want to use it for artistic reasons because you like the way it sounds, go nuts. But as a system tech, I have full responsibility for the signal chain and everything in it, so if I can't tell you what the device is doing to my signal, I'm not going to put it in the signal chain. (This isn't about condemning certain products; it's about educating myself about what those products do, and then making an informed decision as to whether or not it's appropriate in the situation.)

&amp;#x200B;

In this specific application, the boxes in question are destined for use as low-profile monitors in a small (okay, tiny) club. Here's how the two Stage Monitor EQ presets affect the response:

[https://imgur.com/fcNb3kk](https://imgur.com/fcNb3kk)

Yikes. I'm concerned about the gain reduction, and I'm not particularly excited about the 1k and 12k peaks either. But my primarly concern lies with the low end. These are small-format monitors, mostly for vocals, on a small, loud stage so we certainly don't need all the LF response when there are large subwoofers a few feet away. I want to reduce the LF buildup from the floor coupling but not mangle the response completely. In general I'll shoot for a highpass rolloff around 100 Hz. I'm not in love with either of the presets, so I figured I'd ""roll my own."" Time to reset the DSP and start from scratch.

[Looking at the 100 Hz and 125 Hz options for the onboard highpass filter](https://imgur.com/kAuvdvd), I didn't really like either of them. The 125 Hz setting (purple trace) rolls off too high to support the vocal fundamental, and the 100 Hz setting (light blue) is probably ""close enough"" but I'd rather split the difference. Additionally, I don't like that bump around 600 Hz.

I was able to create [this response](https://imgur.com/XcEJqxo) using a combination of a lo-shelf (-2 dB @ 200 Hz) and a 100 Hz HPF along with a parametric cut at 200 Hz (-2 dB, Q = 0.7). Now the LF is more of a mesa and less of a hump, and I'm still a comfortable ways down by 80 Hz. Another -2 dB filter at 800 (Q=0.5) tamed that midrange bump that would have sounded unpleasant with most vocal mics.

The install itself is going to have to happen in a very small time window because the club has scheduled events, so my strategy was to get things as close to dialed in as possible while still at the shop. Once I get into the room next week, I should be in the ballpark, only needing to adjust for the effects of the specific acoustic environment. A theme in common with my previous posts: note that we don't need a ton of EQ to get results. The filters are wide and gentle. Nothing crazy here.

In conclusion, I would say that presets can be handy timesavers if they work for you. Whenever possible, before using one, I'd like to confirm for myself exactly what it's doing.

Mic Boom Stands - What Have You Used?,"Hello, I'm pretty new here and only really stumbled upon this sub while researching mic stands. It's been awhile since anyone has talked about boom stands so I thought it'd be nice to have another post

&amp;nbsp;

What I've gathered from this sub from previous posts:


* K&amp;M 210/9 - Basically industry standard, easy to get replacement parts
* DR Pro boom stand - In between budget stands and K&amp;M (maybe closer to K&amp;M 210/9?), difficult to get replacement parts
* TAMA boom stands - A little more unknown, but said to be of high quality
* Hercules boom stands- Some have said good things about them
* Atlas stands - high quality

All of the above seem to hover around a similar price point ($50-70+), except for maybe the DR Pro whose price seems to be everywhere

&amp;nbsp;

But what about more budget-oriented stands like this [Auray MS-5230T with telescoping boom](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/755878-REG/auray_ms_5230t_tripod_microphone_stand.html)?

These budget stands seem to be good if you aren't lugging them around constantly. What has everyone's experience been like in 2018?

Gear for the performer to control playback of backing tracks,"Hello!  I have no idea what my friend needs, and neither does he.  We are both long time live musicians.  Long time enough that we are getting old and slowing down.

Looking to upgrade speakers soon.. Need some advice on maintenance and safety tips,"I've been using the Peavy PR12, Yamaha DXRs and Mackie Thumps in the past for the band. Never really owned speakers. I've looked around and the band is considering a big jump into better speakers as we're starting to pick up shows. We're still stuck between a few speakers -- Yamaha DSRs, QSC K12.2 along with a sub (still looking around). The fact stands that these are HUGE investments for us. To be honest, I do not know much on how to maintain speakers and make them last... :/ I want to make sure when we buy the speakers that the band has a general education on safety speakers so you know the heads doesn't blow out. At the very least, I understand that make sure mixer is turned off when no one is playing in case a player unplugs their instrument cable, minimize feedback, don't overdrive speakers , and leave headroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions/concerns:

1. Since I'm looking at powered speakers, what does watts and ohms have to do with active speakers? I keep reading that under powered amps can clip the amps but if I'm using powered speakers, where do amps, watts, and ohms play into this? I think this is more of an issue for passive speakers?
2. With the speakers I've used in the past, I've had to push my faders to the max and gains on the speakers for some outdoor events. In hindsight, I might have been pushed the speakers to the limits, leaving little headroom. Is there a way to reduce that? I'm more concerned about sound output for some events that are outdoors and less than 500 people. With the DSRs or QSC K12.2s, I don't think sound output is an issue, so I wouldn't need to push my faders and speakers to the max?
3. For smaller events, should I still use the DSRs/QSCs or should I try to ask the venue/friends if they have smaller ones? My concern is using the speakers too much could cause them to wear down. Not sure if that is a correct assumption. 
4. How important is the warranty? Do speakers break down easily? If I could get them on ebay/refurbished for cheaper rather than through an authorized seller with warranty, I would to save a few hundred dollars. 

Speakers seem kinda fragile to me and I don't want to damage a high investment item. Compared to computers which are more meant to be overclocked, it seems like pushing speakers to their limits will kill it. I want to be able to utilize/optimize the speakers to their fullest potential but leaving headroom seems to be more ideal.

Any more tips and common mistakes you see from DJs/audio engineers handing speakers are greatly appreciated for someone who will soon be the owner of expensive-ass (for us) speakers.

Questions for Recording a Band at the House,"Hey all, Im going to keep this short and sweet.

We have two monitors that we want to use to hear our vocals while we record, what do we need on a mixer in order to do this?

From my understanding, which very well could be wrong is you have your monitors hooked up to the ""main output"" on a mixer. Since we have a small budget I only see mixers with a ""main output"" and a ""output (volume) level."" This would mean that if the gained is turned up on an input that input signal would also come out of the monitors as well. The only thing we want through the monitors is vocals when we are recording. How do make it so only the vocals will be sent to the monitors and nothing else? Can anyone recommend a good mixer that has this ability and also has a USB output for under $200. ",t2_6hf1231,1,1

Sennheiser e906 For Choir???,"Usually outdoors.  Between 20-80 singers.  Sometimes a very VERY lively stage, due to the brick walls all around and concrete floor, nothing absorbent except for the singers bodies.

What do yall think about using e906 mics for choir?  Is two adequate for a 24-foot wide stage?  I typically use SDCs, but I want to try some dynamics because the sound is too bright and prone to feedback in the mids.  My understanding is that these e906 mics might be a narrower pattern than the SDCs I've typically used.

Edit: I tried two 906s for a few different children's choirs singing outdoors.  Probably the most gain-before-feedback I've ever gotten in this scenario.  Great sound...meh...but people could actually hear them scream the christmas songs!",t2_f32sp,19,1

Rack case cable management?,"Hey guys - sorry if this isn't the correct place to post, but I had a question about rack case cable management.

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently been recording a lot more live shows which essentially requires me to break down some of my studio gear and transplant it into a rack case. I'm a cable management freak so I bought duplicate power cords for all my gear and an additional power conditioner so I won't have to go about unplugging and replugging all my cords in this process. I figured this way I can leave all my primary power cords plugged into my studio rack, and all my duplicate power cords plugged into my road case and just have to worry about the actual gear.

&amp;#x200B;

To give you an idea of what I'm working with, here's how my current in-studio rack is laid out:

&amp;#x200B;

Monster Power Pro 950*\*power cables resting on top of Apollo\**UAD ApolloDigimax D8

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, I'm mainly only using my Apollo for the live recording, but anticipate having to bring the Digimax in the future. My main issue is that when I take the Apollo out, all the power cords are resting pretty much directly on top of it, causing them all to fall down when I remove it/a nightmare when I have to put the Apollo back into the rack.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you guys go about cable management in a situation like this? As I mentioned before, I don't need to unplug any of these cables from the power conditioner - I'm okay with a permanent/semi-permanent solution, unless I end up having to replace a faulty cable or something of course. My initial thought is a rack shelf so the cables can rest on that instead of the Apollo, but I don't want to just have wasted space directly above the Apollo. Could I screw a rack shelf and my power conditioner into the same spot in the rack so the shelf is still holding the cables, but there isn't a 1U gap between the power conditioner and Apollo?

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips would be greatly appreciated - thanks, guys!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Forgot to mention I currently have 8 devices plugged into the power conditioner in my studio rack, (PC, monitors, etc.), and those along with the rack gear cables are what I'm trying to keep from falling whenever I remove the Apollo.",t2_o9qhxzi,4,1

Any good sources to learn more about bigger sound systems/techniques?,"For the duration of my live sound career (7 years), I’ve always done small to medium sized gigs. Clients that come in always say I do a great job, which is reassuring but I look at some of the gigs that this sub does and it’s definitely daunting. 

Typical gigs I do involve 32 channel sound craft or Midas m32, 2 subs on the floor, and 4-8 speakers for mains, 4-8 speakers for monitors, etc...

I feel confident with this size setup, but I’ve always wondered about the bigger setups. 

Professional bands come through my venue all the time and they bring in huge line arrays, everything connected over Dante, huge mixing consoles, etc.. 

We never do that with my company. Without sounding cocky, im the one with the most knowledge and experience which sucks in a way because I don’t learn more from a mentor. 

Sorry for the length, but my question is do you have any good sources for learning all the ins and outs of these bigger systems? 

I’ve never used line arrays, Dante, AES, all that. I’m looking to get into a gig with bigger systems, but don’t want to look like a scrub when I come in. I feel like as long as I’m good at mixing that it’s all the same, I just need to learn how these bigger systems work. ",t2_epg1boo,19,1
Something Better Than Yamaha DXR10?,"I am a DJ and I have had my Yamaha DXR10s for about 5 years as my main speakers.  I slightly downgraded from QSC HPR122i speakers because of their size a weight, but I loved how clean, crisp and transparent the QSCs sounded but traded that clarity for the size and weight reduction of the DXR10s.  Truth is, I've never been crazy about how the DXRs sounded.  Yesterday, I borrowed a Meyer UPM from work and did an A/B comparison with my 12"" sub and the Meyer simply smoked the DXR in everything except bass which is to be expected.   My wife put it like this, the UPM was like getting hit with soft balls of sound whereas the DXR was like getting hit with Lego bricks of sound.  Now we are talking about a $2000 Meyer vs a $600 Yamaha, but there has to be something out there that is compact and has a sound similar to the Meyer or even the QSC for less than say $1200 a cabinet. 

I'm asking here because DJs generally confuse loud with sounding good.  I am looking for clarity and compactness over the ability to get stupid loud.  This would be paired with a pair of subs to do wedding/private party levels for 150-200 people.

"Live sound engineers of reddit, how would you feel about a guitarist using an XY mic pattern, but for Guitar amps in stereo.","I’ve recently been running two guitar amps in stereo. I know, bad idea, apologies in advance. 


Anyway, I’ve been experimenting with distance apart, but the stages we play on don’t always allow for exact placement. We try to just let the sound guys do their thing and keep stage volume decent.

Could placing the amps (a Princeton and an ac15) near center stage at 90 degrees to each other, facing inward and tilted up, with the bottom front corners of the amps nearly touching, be a safe and effective way to eliminate potential phase issues, even if the spread doesn’t feel as wide to the audience? Or, do phase issues just not really matter when amps are micd?

Just curious as it sounds pretty good at home when I tried it, and more often than not the amps are micd and running through the pa panned hard right and left.

Discussion: Word Clock Recommendations,"Howdy folks!

Relatively young in the live sound engineer career path and starting to get a grasp on the idea of jitter within live digital audio systems set up. I've been recommended word clocks as a method of ""cleaning up"" the sound of older digital consoles - á la Yamaha's LS9 and of course the SC48s of the world. 
I was actually thinking of going out on a limb and buying one myself for tours and getting that more consistently decent sound especially out of the more aged consoles of the digital realm. Which leads me onto opening the floor to discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of having an external Word Clocks.

Mixing for broadcast (but kind of a weird situation) - advice?,"I hustled up some work at a local small town cable channel, handling the live recording of a Christmas music showcase.

Literally the only standards they gave me for the final mix was ""We broadcast in mono...""   I asked about their signal processing and they said ""oh, we don't do any of that.""

So here's my question - in this situation, how would your mix sound?  Should I give them a 'good' mix, or should I give them a pre-smashed mix for broadcast, or should I give them something in the middle?

Help getting PA for band. Small college bars/clubs (50-200 people),"Up until now most venues I’ve played had their own PA, but I’ve been getting a lot more private gigs and was recently offered a spot to be a weekly performer at a local bar every Friday night. I need to get my own PA setup and I’m curious on what I should do.

As of right now, we use a pretty crappy passive speaker system when we cant use the venues PA. Our lead guitar and bassist use their own amps and we don’t run those through the PA generally, Nor do we mix the drums. Just unnecessary for the smaller bars we play right now. 

I also do plenty of solo/duo acoustic gigs as well and this would also be for those. Those tend to be more restaurant/coffeeshop style events, though.

Right now I’m trying to decide between getting:

2 Mackie SRM650’s

Or

1 QSC 12


Now if I go the QSC route, I will definitely add a second speaker down the line, just not yet as they are way more expensive. I’ve just heard these are leagues better than the Mackie’s.

I also feel like I’d be able to get by with the one speaker for now since id mostly need it for the solo stuff until I get a second one. Then maybe we will venture into mic’ing everything through the PA.

Query: Methods for making two lectern mics cut out when not in use?,"Hello folks. Hope people don't mind me picking their brains a bit.

I've got this vague task to help a local church re vamp their PA system a bit.  They have a consistent problem with extraneous noise from the road, from crowds singing and from instruments giving them feedback.

When they took it to a pro audio install place the method they were looking at supplying/installing were amps with voice activated relays/Vox features.  But the requirements are for two speakers (that's human speakers) and by the time you find an amp with two vox enabled mic inputs they seem to be very high end and expensive as well as having a slew of features more suited to an airport or megamall.  A total waste in a dinky little local church.

Foolishly I suggested there must be some custom set up possible here, if off-the-shelf doesn't have the feature mix you want. So here I am doing research.

The set up is this:  Two readers/lecturers sit or stand at a big desk or lectern quite close together (a couple of feet apart).  They talk in alternate blocks and when either or both of them aren't talking it'd be great if their mic turned off.

Why does this have to be automatic?  Because there's a rotation of presenters and they are completely unskilled and often old.  Requiring them to develop mic technique and/or fiddle with switches and settings has proven problematic before.  So eliminating that would be great.  This is also why anything requiring computer software is out as well.

What I would love is some sort of relay switch box you just patch in behind the mics that only lets the signal through when someone talks into it loudly enough.

I've found products like these:

http://www.optogatesolutions.com/index.html

But they are infra red operated.  Unfortunately these readers are always present in front of their mics.  If they were audio operated that would be perfect.

My electronics isn't very good, so such thing might be impossible and I just don't know it.  I've been casting around for other solutions, like a little relay switch with its own mic that turns on the main one, for example  ( [like this one](https://quasarelectronics.co.uk/Item/cebek-pm-14-vox-controlled-relay-switch-module-with-microphone) ).  But that's an extreme option.

Another alternative is simply some sort of noise gate which we might be able to hack in there somehow.

Anyway, I won't bore folks too much(too late?)

Short version:  What's a good way to make a mic automatically shut off when not being spoken into? Any gear or solutions anyone knows about or suggestions they might want to make would be great",t2_6lfel,1,1
PA Processing / Systems Tech,"Diving in to a new arena of mixing for corporate shows and cultural programs. I get lots of compliments for my mixing though I’ve learned from working with some pros. I’m a musician turned audio guy, ear is pretty sensitive to overall sound. 

This is for the phasing issues a PA (small or big) encounters and how some technicians help repair. Most guys are all on SMAART and the others simply apply a little delay down the line till the PA sounds good. 

Just seems like both work, weighing or out-weighing the pro’s/con’s. 

So much information available online but limited time to read it all. 

I’m hardly in the big arena, most of my gigs are outdoors with speakers on sticks/truss or in hotel ballrooms where we fly self-powered speakers and keep subs on the floor. 

All of my eq/comp/delay (dsp) is done off the M32 but with limited inserts I’ve been looking for a solution to handle this. 

So, dbx Driverack Venue360. Seems to handle all the dsp outside the mixer and now gives you remote WiFi view w iPad. You guys have any good or bad on this? May jump and buy two of these for multiple setups. 

Let me know...

Looping Pedal for live drumming,"Hello Colleagues!

I am in the market for a looping pedal to use with my hybrid drum kit setup. I have previously used the Looper function in Ableton, but I'd like a hardware version to use. I'm not interested in anything prolific, just something that will allow looping, overdubbing, and it built well. I've seen some folks using the Boss RC 1 &amp; 3 and the TC Electronics Ditto. I don't think I need any onboard drum patterns, but it wouldn't be a deal breaker if the unit had them.

Blues Rock,"Hey folks, just wanted to text around and let you know that I feel blues rock, in most if not all guises, is literally shit. I was working the sound for a gig of it, and I was writing some thoughts down about it with ear plugs in, and I got into a spot of trouble with an audience member for it, maybe like a soldier scared to fight, and I wondered if anybody had any thoughts on how we could eradicate this together for good, to stop future generations succumbing to it and to stop kids having to grow up with it in pubs when they have them boards outside saying “live music” but in capital letters. Whenever I hear something “modern” that’s perhaps got a quick nod to blues rock I realised I think subconsciously  “aww that’s cute”. I only just realised that I can’t process it as music. Not a snob thing at all. It’s something else. My brain responds to full blues rock like it’s being invaded by a mindsucking bacteria. No matter how proficient the guitar solo or impassioned the vocal, it still gets me as a total emptiness. Like if pure cliche was a sensation, or an energy, then blues is the epicentre. Beyond boring, into something further, it shows you a 3D space behind the bore, an omni-bore, but it has nowhere to go, it is the blues. It’s like if you’re playing wrestling with a friend when you are about ten, and then they quickly shock you by pulling out a choke hold and squeeze your neck in real quick, and it feels really dangerous and then they go back to playing and say “Gotchya” in a nice voice, that’s like my first exposure to the blues. It’s like my neck is a little bit crushed, so the choke hold can’t squeeze it right anymore, but the hold is in place anyway, so I try and hold myself together and get through it.
The justification for it is that old blues lead to rock n roll. I think that this might be propaganda, and even though the evidence is there buried within the chords and voicing and occasional digga digga, that is no reason to trust history to the extent that we perpetuate this as a reason to give it reverence. No I say, much of my own music can sound like annoying rubbish, but nothing is like blues rock. I think we should have a discussion with each other about how we can best broach a potential decommissioning, to leave it to the few players that really seem to be able to play blues and make it have something. Maybe there could be a license or something you can get, I’m not sure if I’m better keeping this to myself but hope it entertained you. I don’t mean any offence, it’s just I think blues rock is flopcum. Best wishes to everyone",t2_10c5tu01,0,1

EAW Radius RSX212L,"I recently had the opportunity to see these speakers in person and I want to see if I'm off base with my opinion. Maybe I'm asking too much of a professional product. 
Alright so the first thing I noticed was the top plate that overhangs slightly above the amp module is very flimsy. I grabbed it and was able to flex it by hand, and heard all kinds of cracking in either the finish, or the wood structure. Also, the metal fixture attached to the back to hold the dust cover in place isn't recessed so I imagine after a season or two of hastily loading into a truck will eventually cause a failure at both of these points from getting smacked around and dragged along a trailer wall.
Next, I realize they're not IP65 but they look particularly vulnerable to even the slightest imperfect weather conditions. 
And the little windows for each of the boxes to communicate? I expect that to be a failure point and sort of pointless. Again- I'm open to be proven wrong on that. 
The drivers share one 1k d class amp module and apparently cannot shade. The horns are run with a 500w module. The consumption rating (250 watts max) doesn't seem high enough to support the rated power output also, but I'm not an electrical engineer so maybe I'm wrong- but typically if an amp module says it's 1500 watts peak, that's about a 13amp draw. The rep told me they easily run 3 boxes off a single u ground with no issues....
And lastly, why the hell is a Chinese box valued so damn high? 
Now that I'm done trashing the boxes I'll say this: they are light as all hell and don't sound too bad in the terrible setting they were being demoed in. In the real world? Who knows. They just seem delicate to me. Also, the coax monitors that were on display sounded really great and had a really nice flat profile. And were also stupid lightweight. Big points there. 
I'd love to hear your input on this stuff because again, maybe I'm asking too much of the build quality of a pro level box?

DVS Redundant recording,"Hey everyone,I'm having trouble with my dante setup. I have two stage boxes (yamaha rio's) connected, via dante and a switch, to a Cl5 and a Ql5for Mons and FOH. I also have a Mac with dante virtual soundcard for live recording. This system is daisy chained and works fine.

The trouble is when I try to set up a redundant network I am unable to see/connect my mac to the network. Thus no recording wich is a problem... To be clear, Only the primairy is connected to my mac. It does not work on the secondairy either. Everything else still works. The problem is not the cables either. A redundant network just seems to keep me from recording.

Any Ideas?

Edit: To clairify: When I switched from daisy chain to redundant, I reconfigured the network correctly (DVS settings,Yamaha settings, rio settings, clock syncs, second switch and secondairy network). The redundant system does work, I just can't record with my mac when it is set up this way. The daisy chained system works and I can record with it. I would like to be able to record on a redundant network.

I like the price point of the XR12 but I'm ok with spending more.

Audio interface vs. old mixer for live mixing. Help?,"Hey. I'm helping a friend mix/live stream a show on Friday. My experience is more in studio production/live performance, but I'm doing it as a favour for him (and for free beers haha). The mixer he's using is an old 8 channel Soundcraft dinosaur, and it looks like the rec out might be a bit buggered.

My question – I have a Saffire Pro 40 which, combined with a specced out MacBook Pro 15, has very, very low latency. I'm wondering if it would make more sense to use this as a live mixer in combination with a APC40 rather than the clunky Soundcraft? I could do much better EQing/compression than with the very basic 3-band on the Soundcraft.

Are there any downsides to this approach – aside from the always present chance of hardware/software malfunction on the MacBook Pro/Saffire side of things? The MacBook has done me well in a live setting over the years with much more heavier CPU stuff than 8 channels w/ parametric EQ/compression. But then again, the Soundcraft looks like it has survived 2-3 decades of use.

Bonham kick,"Greetings, my drummer just picked up a new kit and I have questions.

How do I get a more modern kick sound (for my typical rock and country cover band) without overriding my drummer's desire for the Bonham feel and ""tone at the throne"" with his new 26x14 kick?

Note, he doesn't have port in the front head. I'm the band leader and I can insist on him using a ported head, but I'm willing to leave it be and try to make it part of our sound....if it doesn't drive me crazy.

I plan to continue to use a D-6 on the front head, with relatively lazy dynamics to punch it up a little.

I can pick up plenty of attack at the beater if I convince him to use a wooden ball like Bonzo did towards the end of his career.

So, what mic for the batter head? I feel like an SM-81 is not the answer here :) and it would be nice if it were something less expensive than an M201TG. I definitely don't need a metal kick drum tone. Maybe I should go simple with an SM57...or even an e609?

&amp;#x200B;

So about a year ago, in my school, we have finally got around to buying a sound mixer. (our school is rather small) And there was this student who was like the technical guy alongside our schools janitor, who would work out all the mixing stuff, speakers, etc. 

I always showed interest to the technical stuff, and even got to mess around with the mixer every now and then. I was suppose to learn from the previous student about using the mixer, but never got around doing it, and now he has moved out of the school to a theater. And that leaves me as the only student who has access to the mixer.

Now our teacher isn't the best at this technical stuff, so I learned everything by myself so far, I know the basics; how to operate the mixer, using the EQ knobs, AUXes, setting everything up, monitors and avoiding feedback, etc..

And now there is a school talent show coming up next year...

&amp;#x200B;

***The TL;DR version is that I need help with mixing for our schools talent show***

The mixer is a **Soundcraft Signature 12,** Most of our microphones are **AKG D5 Vocals,** for the speakers I have **2 medium sized speaker (sorry, don't know the name), 1 Roland microcube and 2 amplifiers(Sorry again), and I will monitor the sound myself using headphones.** All of the space is mostly made out of wood, and it is not very big, I am bad at estimating but I am guessing like 10m x 10m to 20m x 20m box, there is little bit of echo.

I think I'll manage it just fine, but here are some of my newbie questions:

1.) Is it safe to plug a phone straight to a channel via line in? (I have an adapter, gonna be using it for some music)

2.) At which angle and position should I place my speakers? 

3.) Can the roland microcube, or one of the amplifiers be used as a monitor, if I turn the effects off.

4.) Is it ok to set gain so low, that the sound level is how I want it, when the faders are set to 0db.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if the questions seem stupid, but do keep in mind, that our school has pretty limited supply of stuff and money + I am just starting out. If anyone has any tips in mind or things I should know, please do share them! Thank you! ",t2_2gyvpbal,3,1
What would be the best approach to reach out to local bars offering to help fix their speaker systems?,"The city in which I live is fairly small (210k pop.) and so is our downtown area where university and college students go often. There's maybe a dozen or so bar/clubs that are the ""major"" go-to's. Everytime I go in one it is either way too loud, poorly EQ'd, set up improperly, or a combination of everything. I want to help fix these systems so people don't get permanent hearing damage - and they'll end up enjoying the club more. People don't realize it, but they'll leave the clubs because their ears are fatigued either through ear piercing EQ or being too loud (or both). Mind you, these are all DJ places, no live bands.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I'm not really sure how to approach these places to offer my help. I mean, I'd prefer if they'd pay me, but knowing this city...highly doubt it.

that Live Aid scene in Bohemian Rhapsody,"For those that have watched the new movie Bohemian Rhapsody...

Is there any way that pushing an analog soundboard’s mains by the huge amount displayed in the movie’s Live Aid scene would not have had instant, disastrous consequences? I would think that doing something like that would have utterly fucked the gain structure, and would have created feeedback, but the movie seems to be using it as a storytelling device that just means “everyone likes Queen.” 

It struck me as a really dumb thing to include in the movie. ",t2_2lgeeh0y,1,1

[Debate] On board graphic EQ's on a digital console serve no purpose.,"They are just a different interface to the same DSP as the parametric eq uses. Analog graphics had differences from the analog parametrics. There were phasing and voicing variations that added flair. The onboard graphic eq is just there as a feature add and  to make the folks who have always done it that way comfortable and you can get the same EQ curve with either tool. [/Debate]

Follow Up: Lectern Mic recommendations,"This is a follow up to my original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/9t1lxo/lectern\_mic\_recommendations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/9t1lxo/lectern_mic_recommendations/)

We installed a Shure MX412 with supercardioid capsule.  I had to high pass at roughly 300 Hz and pull a LOT of frequencies, and we still cannot get enough gain before feedback.  I think we've reached the max, as now basically it started feeding back at all the other freqs that have not been pulled down.

I asked the guy I had speaking into the mic for ringing out to try a beta 87A a the same distance as the lectern mic.  We were able to get much better tone and much better gain before feedback out of the beta 87A, with minimal EQ.

I have to say I'm a little disappointed in the MC412.  I know lectern mics are supposed to be wide and catch all, but it won't work in this venue.  The client was impressed with the clean look of the thin gooseneck mic, but it is nearly unusable in this venue.  The PA is hung above and it probably 12-15 feet away, and about 4 or 5 feet out from the mic capsule (roughly, I didn't measure).  Very lively room when empty, so I figured if we can get it run out empty, it should be good full.  Nope, it aint.

Ugh.  What makes the Beta 87 so much better at this than the MX412?",t2_f32sp,1,1

Tips/suggestions/methods for ringing out systems?,"So I’m a fairly new (about two years) live sound tech for a small event production company. I run sound for a lot of events like galas, auctions, fundraisers corporate programs, etc. We bring all of our own sound equipment, including an X32 (I know, I know) and QSC KLA12s, K12s, and K8s. 

I’m not bad at my job but I could definitely use some tips on ringing out systems and controlling feedback, especially for our podium and lav mics (our Sennheiser handhelds rarely give me problems). I usually have my gain set between 17 and 24 (ish) and I use both the 4-band graphic EQ as well as the Dual Graphic EQ’s under effects, but I always seem to find myself fighting for volume since I end up cutting so much out in the EQ and still end up with feedback (doesn’t help that I work in a lot of school gyms with concrete walls and parallel surfaces galore).

Looking for advice on recording a speaker,"At my church we have a MG20XU yamaha board with a USB port but we're looking to record the pastor's messages alone. I usually used the Aux 1-2 channels for monitors for the pianist and drummer and so I figured I could hookup a 1/4 to 3.5mm adapter to the 3rd auxilliary input to plug into a device to record his channel indivually, but there have so far been 2 problems.

1. The auxiliary 3 channel doesn't seem to play audio for any of my mains stuff (so i plugged the same monitor from aux 1 into aux 3 and turned the dial up the same and nothing came out of aux 3)

2. Nothing i try gets any device to recognize any output from the board as a recordable source. I've tried the monitor outputs on the board and the headphone channel that you use to listen to the channels from the PFL button. But the devices we've used (2 android phones and a macbook) have yet to recognize it and record it.

I was wondering if I needed like a middle man device like a direct box or one of those miniature mixers that are ment for like a desktop microphone or something along the lines to record the channel.

Edit: I've only been able to get the USB channel as an input source to play audio from a computer to the board and I was wondering if there was a way to flip the USB channel to an output of the board back into the computer to record.",t2_9eg6tqv,1,1

Question about equipment transportation and rack mounting 'alternatives',"First off, I apologise if this is a dumb question. I feel I'm looking for something that doesn't exist, but I honestly don't know what to look up to get an answer in the first place!

\-------

A couple of the bands I perform with are looking to expand their setups for IEMs and the like. In an ideal world that means rack mounted transmitters and audio interfaces, a mixer for IEMs, maybe a Kemper in there... you get the idea. In both cases, each band member would be responsible for their part of the setup. I've just bought a wireless transmitter/receiver myself.

The issue I have is that I am by no means a wealthy person, and I can't really afford to buy double of everything for both of my bands. Also thinking long-term, there might be times I want to remove the transmitter, or take the Kemper out on its own. This means that rack mounted isn't a great option... but I really want a way of making sure that when I do play with these bands, we can transport all the gear securely, and when we get to the venue we can still plonk our systems on stage, power it on and everything's sorted.

\-------

The TL;DR is basically - is there a way of getting the best of both worlds here? Have all the gear set up nicely and securely for shows, while also allowing me to easily remove my stuff? My only guess is some kind of clamp rack than using screws, or I just get a rack for myself to put on top of the 'band rack', and suck it up when I need to take it apart. But I just don't know.

Monitor external mic and iPad on headphones,"I hope I am right in this subreddit and you can help me.

I currently use a Zoom H1 to record speech and simultaneously, but independently an iPad for communication through Facetime. The problem with this setup is that I only have the conversation partners on the headphones, but no monitor of the H1 and therefore my voice.

Thus I tried to use the output of the H1 (1) as input for the iPad (R), but additionally get the output of the iPad (G) and the monitor on my headphones – And it worked. At least until I tried replicating the same setup. Even after exchanging all cables, I still get the iPad output and monitor on my ears, but the iPad only uses the internal microphone and not the output of the H1.

But if I keep this setup and just remove the adapter in front of the headphones (2) and iPad output, the H1 output will again be used by the iPad as the primary input, but of course I no longer have sound on my headphones. So I'm assuming there's some kind of short-circuit problem.

I think all cables and adapters are 3,5 mm TRS except for the “RG” adapter on the iPad which is TRRS to 2xTRS.

Can you help me find the bug in this setup, or some other solution? I'm aware that I won't achieve audiophile miracles with this setup, but that's not the purpose either. It is important for me to have the iPad and H1 output on my headphones.

Between The Lines #3: How To Find Line Array Splay Angles,"*I know, I know. I just posted. I'm preparing a PowerPoint presentation so I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone. After this post, I'll shut up for a while.*

**When preparing the configuration of a ""line array"" (technically an asymmetrical composite coupled point source) I start with three pieces of information:**

**1) What is the desired coverage angle?** (From the loudspeaker's point of view, the angle from the last row to the front row.)

**2) What is the range ratio?** (How far the top box needs to throw to the last coverage row, divided by how far the bottom box needs to throw to the first coverage row.)

**3) How many boxes are in the hang, and what splay angle settings are available?**

In the example I've made up, the coverage angle is about 45° and I've given myself a budget of 12 boxes.

[https://imgur.com/fk1kIGp](https://imgur.com/fk1kIGp)

The absolute throw distances are not nearly as important as the relationship between them. In this case, it's 2.9 times farther to the last seat than the first seat.

Let's start with a big ole' constant curvature source and just cover the angle: 12 boxes at 4° splay gives us 48° of coverage.

[https://imgur.com/rcmo0yN](https://imgur.com/rcmo0yN)

I didn't take the time to add big bold lines for the coverage line, but you can clearly see the seating shape. ***The gif animates, showing the prediction on octave centers from 250 Hz to 8 kHz.***

This is a symmetrical array that creates a completely symmetrical coverage pattern. **Note that due to the symmetry, we know that the geometrical center of this array - between boxes 6 and 7 - is on-axis (ONAX) for all frequencies.** That seems obvious now, but file it away.

The problem is that the desired coverage area is not symmetrical. Everyone will hear the show, but the folks in the front are going to hear it about 9 dB louder than the folks in the back. We know this thanks to the inverse squared law: for a range ratio of 2.9,

*20log(2.9/1) = 9 dB*

What about AutoSplay? The software gives angles of

2,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,6,6

(that's 11 angles, because it's 12 boxes). Zero-degree splays cause a whole bunch of problems but what I'd like to focus on here is the problems that Auto-splay presents for trying to EQ the array. The onaxis (ONAX) mic position is the mainstay of the EQ process, and this is where we run into problems: where is ONAX?

[https://imgur.com/p0iUf0A](https://imgur.com/p0iUf0A)

The main coverage lobe - the loudest point along the coverage angle - now shifts over frequency. Why this happens is not a quick explanation, but it has to do with the amount of directional control the array as a whole and the individual boxes can exert over different wavelengths. As frequency falls, wavelengths get longer and the direction in which the box is pointed matters less and less. **The takeaway here is that we no longer have anywhere to place the reference mic that is representative of the array as a whole, and thus no firm basis on which to make effective EQ decisions.** This is not the fault of AutoSplay, rather it's the consequence of having an asymmetrical array shape (created by AutoSplay).

So let's skip the AutoSplay and come up with our own splay angles. The following is heavily based on the McCarthy / Meyer approach with a few little adaptations of my own. For the full story, read [Bob's book](https://www.amazon.com/Sound-Systems-Optimization-Techniques-Alignment/dp/0415731011/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1542162504&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bob+mccarthy+sound+systems+design+and+optimization). The idea behind an articulated ""line array"" is that we can use overlapping coverage of adjacent boxes to create summation and offset the level variance. We need more level towards the back, so we want more overlap towards the top of the array. How much more? Range ratio was 3:1, so let's use three times as much overlap at the top. (Put another way, a ratio of 1:3 between the angles at the top and bottom of the array). In theory this offsets the range ratio, although this is one of the areas where I depart from Bob McCarthy's guideline. I find that a splay ratio 30 - 50 % larger reduces the amount of shading I need later.

**If we divide the array into composites, and we keep each composite symmetrical, we can ""solo"" each section of the array and know exactly where ONAX is for all frequencies**, no different than working with a single loudspeaker. Then we just combine them and use EQ to compensate for the combination effects (namely LF buildup) and we're good to go. The top composites need to go further so in general they should consist of more boxes at smaller splay angles.

Out of my 12 boxes, I did four composites, A, B, C, and D. There's a little guess test and revise based on the angles your particular system can actually hit, but let's go with

A= 4 boxes @ 2° (for a total of 8°),

B= 3 @ 2° (for a total of 6°),

C=  3 @ 4° (for a total of 12°), and finally

D= 2 @ 8° (for a total of 16°).

That gives me a grand total of 42° of coverage, plus the ""fringes"" that extend past the ONAX of the topmost and bottommost boxes.

**There's no magic here. Just keep pushing and pulling and obeying the guidelines of fewer boxes per composite at larger angles as we go down.**

When we translate that into interbox angles (which we need to give the software and the riggers) we get:

(2-2-2) 2 (2-2) 3 (4-4) 6 (8)

The parentheses indicate interbox angles within each composite (A, for example has 4 boxes and therefore three interbox angles) and the transitional splay angles (between composites) are visible between the groups. Another brilliant convention of Bob's that we can't fully dive into here.

The trends are observed: fewer boxes at wider splays as we go down, and the bottom splay is 4 times the top splay, so we've more than offset the range ratio.

Each symmetric element then has a clearly defined ONAX at all frequencies, allowing us to place a mic and apply equalization. The animation shows the frequency range for each composite segment in turn:

[https://imgur.com/efWatco](https://imgur.com/efWatco)

The computer took the liberty of rescaling the color key for each frequency, which is annoying, but the general concept is clearly visible.

[The combined EQ process is tricky](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/study_hall/choose-your-battles-examining-dispersion-pattern-control-in-line-arrays/) and I won't get into it here, but once we put everything together, we can achieve extremely even coverage.

[https://imgur.com/UhJAafS](https://imgur.com/UhJAafS)

The LF lobe will still radiate from the geometric center of the array since the wavelengths are so long, the few degrees of splay are practically ignored. Some platforms allow a little all-pass steering here, but even without it, we have a very well-behaved PA system.

One last note: it's a bit hot down in front, so after doing what we can with splay, a little shading can go a long way. Taking the bottom two composites (bottom 5 boxes) down by 3 dB results in an even lower-variance coverage scenario:

[https://imgur.com/ocptJrh](https://imgur.com/ocptJrh)

Before we head to catering, let's address the shading issue. There's sometimes a concern about how much headroom is lost by turning some of the boxes down. The boxes have the most overlap at LF, so that's where the largest potential losses would occur. In this case, taking 5 out of 12 boxes down by 3 dB creates a loss of just over 1 dB of LF headroom...Nothing to be scared of.

Question on Feedback Noise,"Hi guys, amateur Live Sound Engineer here. So a few days ago I had a gig for a 1 night event featuring 4 bands. There was notable feedback on a couple of performances, overall happened about 4 times maybe over the course of 5 hours. 


The setup was simple, 2 mics, 2 channels for guitars, 2 for keyboards (wasn’t used much) &amp; 1 for Cajon (wasn’t used much). The stage had monitors for the performers and I was using an average digital mixer. 

The crew I was working with didn’t speak English as their first language but one of the stagehands that would usually assist the Live Sound Engineer I was filling in for told me that it’s usually because of the Gate on the vocals. Of course I was confused and asked him to explain further, through broken English he mentioned it was something along the lines of hot levels getting picked up by the stage monitors from the vocals and I had to bring down the Gate threshold to allow more signal in otherwise the voice cuts. I’m just confused as to how this relates to unwanted feedback. I believe the same thing happened during the last performance although the setup of the band was slightly different. The guitarist was building loops on his pedal when feedback occurred. 

Hope some can decipher what happened based on the information I provided and help explain to me what’s going on because I’m still confused. 

Thanks in advance to commenters and sorry if those that want to help don’t have enough to go on. Cheers. ",t2_2gudeou6,2,1

Billing equipment,"I'm back with another billing question! I'm looking for some generally acceptable prices (and situations) for billing personal equipment.

I've developed a toolbox for A1/A2 work, and my thinking is that I don't bill for tools that simply enhance my work, as opposed to contributing to the production directly.
So I can bring my own iPad and router if I want, I can run my analyzer if I want, but the price of that equipment is folded into my rate personally.

HOWEVER. A company has told me that their freelancers typically carry their own laptop and interface (or Dante virtual soundcard) for cues and music. I'm perfectly willing to clean up a laptop and get it show ready, but it seems like my personal computer would save them from providing a playback device, and is definitely something I should charge for daily.

Does anyone charge for bringing a laptop in a situation like this? Does anyone charge for simply bringing an iPod for music? (If it is expected, but wasn't provided by the company).

Between The Lines #2 - Broad Strokes,"*Hi all. Read on for part 2 of the same system we were looking at the other day. Interesting application as it's a listening room, so we're only concerned about the system response at a single point in space. This side-steps a lot of the spacial variance issues that are at the heart of sound system optimization for large venues, but there are still some basics we can take a look at. If you missed part 1, it is* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/9vv55w/between_the_lines_1_interpreting_the_phase_trace/)*.*

I'm going to start by just looking at the left side on its own. There's a great debate over whether a sound system's frequency response should be flat or tilted, and then how much tilt, and what corner frequency, and on and on. For a variety of opinions, see this [Roundtable article](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/live-sound/flat-or-tilted-a-variety-of-approaches-to-the-system-tuning-process/).

Also, check out this [article on the subject by FOH engineer Jim Yakabuski](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/live-sound/backstage-class-a-tuning-standard/). I am fortunate to call Jim a friend and we've had many conversations about this particular topic. For me personally it depends on what the system will be used for (speech or music) as well as the local acoustic environment (how much LF buildup the room will contribute). Ultimately this question will be answered by listening to reference recordings and tweaking the tilt until it sounds correct. Then that becomes the target curve, to which I'll match the rest of the system. ""Rest of the system"" in this case means the other side.

The initial response actually had a slight upward tilt to it. Look at 3 kHz and up:

[https://imgur.com/a9e7Pax](https://imgur.com/a9e7Pax)

This is partly because the room is small enough that a lot of the HF bouncing off the walls and ceiling shows up in the measurement (notice poor coherence) and also partly because we're only about 15 feet away from a relatively large loudspeaker that's designed to throw a lot farther than across a living room, so there's not nearly as much HF air attenuation as we would see further back in its intended application. This makes sense, but it sounded quite bad (as confirmed by listening to my reference music) so let's fix that.

[https://imgur.com/3AoRaS9](https://imgur.com/3AoRaS9)

Pink = pre-EQ (raw response)

Blue = post-EQ.

Now, hold your horses. I'm sure you are wondering about that 63 Hz peak, and I'll get there. I used a hi-shelf filter at 3 kHz to get rid of that upward tilt, and a cut at around 400 Hz  to rein in that midrange bump. That might be a lobe from the crossover (it's a 15"" system and the listening position is vertically below ONAX but 400 still seems low to me), or it might be a modal thing. The deep, narrow cancellations on either side lend credence to both hypotheses, and since they're cancellations you can't EQ them back up to normal (to a first approximation that is true). If it is modal, good acoustic treatment can do a world of good. But that's not within the scope of the job.

Okay, so for the 63 Hz issue: this looks surprisingly similar to the ""sub bump"" that you see on a modern large format PA system out of the box (see [this image](https://imgur.com/iUBw6Nt). If it looks familiar it's because it's from the same setup as pictured in the Jim Yak article I linked above. Jim snapped it on his phone. It shows his K2 rig ""out of the box"" with subs muted and there's still a heck of an LF bump. His magnitude trace is bottom pane, which is the Smaart default). Since this system is primarily going to be used for the owner to play loud rock music, I left it. We're running without subs here so this is actually an impressive showing. It didn't sound resonant or honky during playback. If it ends up being too much we can always go back and roll it back, but I suspect it will work out well for the owner of the system. This is a judgement call, though, so there's no right or wrong, just what's best for the situation.

Usually, we also feed the output of the DSP into the analyzer so we can see the EQ curve on the screen as well. While this is extremely helpful, it's not strictly necessary, and in this case it's not possible since the DSP is onboard the active loudspeakers, so here we just see the before and after response. I'll include a screenshot of the final filter settings from the DSP at the end so you can see the filters I used.

The applied EQ looks like a relatively minor change on the screen but boy, did it sound a whole lot better. I'm using 1/12 oct averaging, which is lower resolution than I usually prefer but because of the low coherence and nasty room problems, more averaging clarified the general trends for me in this case.

**We're dealing in broad strokes here, not trying to go in and equalize every single little bump. For a variety of reasons, the small-scale details tend not to be very audible, whereas the ear is incredibly responsive to the wideband stuff. For example, after listening, the HF still sounded too bright and one more dB on the shelf worked wonders. So by focusing on the broad strokes we can make some really big improvements with relatively few (gentle!) filters.**

Note the phase response before and after is **almost identical.** The filters here are so low-Q that there's virtually no change. This would not be the case for really narrow, high-Q filters, which are all too often adopted by the ""autoEQ"" plugins, etc. The phase shift itself is of course not audible, but the resonances certainly can be.

Now let's go back and see the Post-EQ left compared to the right channel.

[https://imgur.com/I7EgJbx](https://imgur.com/I7EgJbx)

The matched phase traces indicate matched arrival times at the listening position (see part 1), and so looking next at the magnitude trace on top, we can see further issues: the right loudspeaker (brown trace) is significantly louder than the left side. If it's within a dB it's nothing to write home about but these graphs have a vertical scaling of 3 dB / division so what we're seeing here is significant. (It's also audible. It's important to always check these things as we go. A simple listening test can prevent you from making bad decisions based on improper or incomplete data. It's important to remember that the analyzer simply gives us more data, and it's up to us to interpret that data and make an informed decision.)

So we need a gain change. How much? It's easy to offset traces in the software until they line up - in this case it ended up being 4 dB. That's larger than a manufacturing tolerance, so before cranking the gain in DSP it helps to actually determine what the issue is. In this case, one of the input gain blocks in the loudspeaker's onboard DSP was set incorrectly, and after removing the attenuation, L and R lined up just fine.

[https://imgur.com/oYEge6o](https://imgur.com/oYEge6o)

Right's just a smidge higher, but that's okay because we're looking at its unequalized response vs Left's equalized response. Since most of the EQ work will be subtractive, this is nothing to be concerned about.

Right-side EQ choices were similarly sparing:

[https://imgur.com/qzdCJwT](https://imgur.com/qzdCJwT)

Red trace is post-EQ.

and here's L and R together:

[https://imgur.com/t62CyVT](https://imgur.com/t62CyVT)

Considering the bad room, L and R are pretty well matched in a tonal sense. The EQ necessary for this was asymmetrical, because the room itself - as well as the loudspeakers' placement within - is also asymmetrical.

[https://imgur.com/YUVcZE4](https://imgur.com/YUVcZE4)

Focus on the white line, because even bypassed filters contribute to the blue shading for some reason. Note that the macro trends are the same: gentle cuts in the lo-mid and the HF. I ended up with two cascaded HF shelf cuts to get it to sound right up top - again, the analyzer cannot provide this data. Trust your ears, but then look at the analyzer so we can correlate what we're seeing with what sounds good.

I know there are some other system techs hiding in the weeds out there, and everyone's got their own recipe, so by all means all corrections / comments / alternate interpretations are welcome.

Heavy subs on an accoustic guitar,"So a fellow engineer on a quality sound system just had a talented, itinerant, musician request heavy subs on his acoustic guitar. This was so he could get some low end when he thumped his guitar. On stage with him were two local vocalists, one with a shaker and tambourine and the other traded out keys, accoustic guitar, electric guitar and kick drum as needed. There was no bass and the kick was only used if the keys weren’t being played.

At first, I hated it. When the subs engaged it almost had an effect like plosives on a microphone without an HPF (not quite, but close). The musician was quite talented with one of the best live vocals I have heard in a long time. I even bought one of his albums. As the set went on, I warmed up to it a bit, but still over all did not prefer it. He is a southern, country boy who frequently plays bars and small venues. So it isn’t really my area of experience. 

Is this typical in some areas? It was just enough that I could see some people liking the sound as a matter of taste, but I can’t imagine it being common practice everywhere.",t2_kjasx,1,1

Looking for audio experts,"So, here's the story.

I  have a security camera in my room and a cheap microphone.  I was  watching Unico and the Magic Island on Sep. 22nd alone in my room.   Later I was listening to the audio from my mic and I swear I heard a  child say ""go unico!"" near the end of the movie.  I don't have any kids  nor have any ever been in my apartment that I'm aware of.

It  gets stranger though.  Later in the evening, at around 8:00 pm I can  hear on the audio what sounds like some song playing very quietly.   There's a woman or a girl singing and something that sounds like a  distorted voice that cuts in occasionally and I think a dog barking and  snarling, then the girl starts singing again.  It goes on like this for  hours and hours.  The problem is it's very quiet and there's a lot of  static.  That plus my air conditioner is crazy loud.

I  tried cleaning it up using ffmpeg's afftdn filter with the shellac  noise type and it worked pretty OK but the air conditioner noise still  drowns a lot out.  I can barely make out the word ""children"" and  ""fingers"" at one point (at around 11 pm)

Also at around that time you can clearly make out the sound of a child's disturbed sleep.

If  anyone can help me isolate the song somehow it would be a great help.  I  just got this feeling that something really sketchy is going on  upstairs.

Best approach to repair rat-chewed cables from board,"This is a church sound system. The snake from the analog board comes into the room pictured here (warning - dead rat in the picture). The white cables coiled on the ground and chewed up by the rat are the output channels from the board. A couple are severed severed completely, and a few are gnawed.

[https://imgur.com/a/QuqfKmd](https://imgur.com/a/QuqfKmd)

What's the best approach to repairing these? They are a direct run from the board - no junctions or splices or whatever.

My thought is to just cut-out the bad sections and solder the ends back together, individually heat-shrinking as well as putting heat shrink over each channel.  Am I oversimplifying?  Should I do anything to restore shielding in each? Thanks!

edit: typing is hard, apparently

Experiences with X32 X-Live vs. Cymatic uTrack?,"Hey there,

has anyone already gotten some experience with the Behringer X-Live card versus the Cymatic Audio uTrack card? I'm trying to chose between the two. Application would be in a X32 Compact with Mackie DL32 via AES50. Would love to eliminate the hassle of an additional System to watch (i.e. laptop running tracks live / reaper).

Cymatic is a bit cheaper (150€ vs 200€), but would mean additional cables for a USB hard drive. Behringer option seems to have redundant recording, which is really important with SD cards (not feeling tooo good about that).

Can the Cymatic uTrack write tracks to a USB thumb drive (granted it can sustain the write speeds of course)?

I seem to remember that the uTrack needs some special software to transcode the audio files afterwards before you can use them? Is that still the case?

Does the uTrack provide control via the X32 direct? It has a record button and a network interface, but I would love it if I can just open up a page on the X32, which seems to be the way the X-live works.

Any real life experiences greatly appreciated!",t2_10pcxy,2,1

"Why is there no ""DAW console?""","It's possible that this exists and I'm not aware of it, so please forgive me in that case-

To clarify what I mean by ""DAW console"" - when you set up a studio or live recording, you'll generally have a DAW and a console that interfaces with it. That creates a redundant situation, because DAWs will typically have a virtual Mixer that has basically all the same functionalities of your physical mixing console.

Even with a simple audio interface without full channel processing, you'll usually still have routing options that operate independently from the internal routing in your DAW, and preamps that need to be controlled separately.

What I think would be interesting is a console that's essentially a glorified Audio Interface + DAW controller, with digitally controlled preamps that are controlled from within the software. All surface controls actually control your DAW's virtual mixer, and all routing mirrors your DAW routing.

The software could be a specialized version of ProTools/Cubase/etc. that's meant to be controlled with this mixer.

The mix engine would be a powerful computer that's dedicated to running the DAW at low latency.

You can then run all your favourite VSTs and plugins during live performances, and you can record multitrack and play things back easily.

Between The Lines #1: Interpreting the Phase Trace,"Welcome to what I plan to be a series of posts showing  analyzer traces from the wild, as well as an explanation of what information I gleaned from that data and how it informed my decisions in the field. Based on my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/9vac2i/system_optimization_qa/), it seems like some more technical writeups might be relevant to this community. I would welcome some feedback as to whether this is the case, if for no other reason than writing them up is time consuming. Okay then, onto the good stuff.

\--

I'm starting with a common topic of confusion: what the heck is this ""phase"" response trace telling us? Well, it tells us a lot of things, but one aspect of it is something like asking the question ""What point in its cycle was this frequency at when the measurement was taken?"" For a single frequency, this tells us just about nothing, but when observed over a frequency range, we can glean a lot of useful information for us. We need to look for trends.

**Here is a very basic rule of thumb that covers a LOT of the common phase trace questions:**

**1) The steeper the phase trace slope, the more time offset exists.**

**2) If the slope is descending left to right, the arrival is late. If the slope is ascending left to right, the arrival is early.**

Let me be clear: the phase trace indicates lots of different things, but this simple concept will get you some clarity in a lot of situations.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see some examples:

[https://imgur.com/e1CAUEZ](https://imgur.com/e1CAUEZ)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a trace taken during the benchtesting of a system processor. *Note that I personally choose to view magnitude response on top and phase response on the bottom. This is the opposite of the default view in Smaart, so just be aware of that.*

There's a few things to point out here:

1. The phase trace is descending left to right, so it's indicating a late arrival, as I mentioned above. In this particular case, I simply hadn't yet added delay to the analyzer to compensate for the device's latency. The trace gets steeper with frequency because the same amount of time offset will cause more phase offset at higher frequencies because those cycles happen faster. This is linear - we have twice as much phase offset at 1k as we do at 500 Hz, because the cycle takes half the time. The slope appears to be increasing because of the log frequency axis. If you were to view the phase trace on a linear frequency axis, it would be a constant slope. If you have REW (which you should, because it's free), give it a try.
2. Looking at the magnitude display, we see that the coherence (the red line across the top) drops above 10 kHz, and the associated frequency response data is no bueno. This is because the time delay is so much that at these frequencies, the information comes back outside the time window and therefore is not considered to correlate with the reference signal. Think about an echo that takes a week to come back - it no longer correlates with what we yelled to cause the echo, and so it's now ""noise."" That's what the coherence trace shows us - how confident it is in the answer it's giving. Put another way, is the frequency response this way because it's related to the reference signal? Or is there just noise in the room that has nothing to do with our test signal? How do we tell HVAC from LF pink noise? The analyzer will do the same calculation a bunch of times and average the result over successive measurements. Returning the same answer over and over is high coherence. If it's wandering around, or what the mic is picking up doesn't seem to be related to the signal we're sending out, coherence drops.

We can actually figure out how much delay we're dealing with by doing a little math. The first wraparound passes through 0 again at just about 1 kHz, so we've gone 360° (one cycle) back over a 1000 Hz range. 1/1000 = 1 ms.

This trick is more or less what we're asking the analyzer to do if we view a group delay plot. Let's enable that option:

[https://imgur.com/v5SRYpI](https://imgur.com/v5SRYpI)

And there you have it. A solid line at about 1 ms. If the phase shift is caused by something other than a linear time offset, this will not be a flat line, so be careful making inferences about the entire frequency range's delay based on using only two points for the (manual, mental) calculation.

If you're wondering what those little wiggles are, I can't say for certain but my hypothesis is that those are the points at which the FFT switches to a different time window length. Maybe someone can enlighten me.

So let's look at how we might actually use this knowledge in the wild.

This image shows measurements taken of two speakers (Left and Right) in a small home audio listening room (with nasty acoustics, but that's another topic).

[https://imgur.com/LMHdaHb](https://imgur.com/LMHdaHb)

We have a few problems here but direct your attention to the phase trace. At the listening position, where this measurement was taken, one of the speakers is arriving earlier (because it's closer). Which one? That would be the thicker teal trace, because it has a steeper slope (more time offset) and it's ascending from left to right (early arrival). We have to look at the HF here because the LF has the normal descending trend associated with LF drivers AND we've got some bad modal issues interfering. We do a whole wrap (whole cycle) between 2k and 3k so let's add a millisecond delay to that channel in the DSP.

[https://imgur.com/AYGEDu3](https://imgur.com/AYGEDu3)

Much better. In a large venue situation (larger than one listener) this is close enough for show business, because moving over one seat will result in a completely different result. But this is a listening room and we know exactly where the listener is going to be sitting so let's get closer.

We're about 90 degrees off at 8 kHz. A full cycle at 8 kHz is .125 ms, so we don't need much delay to fix this. In fact, a quarter cycle (90°) would be 31 microseconds (heh) so let's change our delay to .95 ms and see if we miss it the other way.

[https://imgur.com/g9bgjGA](https://imgur.com/g9bgjGA)

We do indeed. The final solution ended up being 0.954ms:

[https://imgur.com/I7EgJbx](https://imgur.com/I7EgJbx)

I could have actually locked in all the way up to 16 kHz given a DSP with sufficient delay resolution, but the distance between the listener's ears is multiple wavelengths at these frequencies so drilling down any further is arguably pointless since both ears can't even perceive the benefit, plus I was ready for my lunch break at that point.

Hopefully this was helpful, and not just a waste of my time. I can't say how often I'll be able to do writeups because I, you know, work. And I really like video games. But happy to answer any relevant questions (about audio, not video games).

I was a huge fan of [Middle Atlantic Robertson rack screws](https://www.redco.com/Middle-Atlantic-HS.html) until I discovered that a few cammed out and stripped. I ordered [Hammond Manufacturing's Philips/Robertson combo screws](https://www.hammfg.com/dci/products/accessories/screw) just now as they seem to better quality and they come in plastic mason jars for storage. 

&amp;#x200B;

I learned ages ago not to over tighten rack screws, and not to use an impact driver. I'm also going to experiment with [ball bearing oil](http://a.co/d/3cbZJaJ) by putting the smallest amount on the threads of the rack screws.

Need help choosing my next pair of loudspeakers,"Hi everyone (forgive me if i’m putting this on the wrong sub),

This is my first time posting to this sub (i’m mostly a scroller) but it seems like theres some really experienced folks on here and I need some help choosing my next speakers.

Some background: I mostly do weddings at small to medium sized venues (usually between 75-250 people). As of right now I use 2 Harbinger V2115 (amateur, I know.. but like most djs, I started with something cheap). These have been very good to me over the last few years and have gotten the job done perfectly but last week (I have no idea how) one of them blew out on me at a gig. So now I am going to purchase a new pair of speakers that will be an upgrade from something entry level like the ones I had. 

I am looking to hopefully stay under 900-1000 U$D for both of them but I want something that will be reliable and loud enought to fill the room for those bigger events. Also, I’d like the speakers to have the ability to purchase speaker covers to protect them on the road as my last speakers sure did take a beating and there weren’t any covers made for them (what do I expect for a cheaper guitar center brand). I’d like them to have 2 inputs (need to have at least one 1/4” TRS) as well as an output for daisy chaining and if they have RCA inputs that would be a huge plus!

Some of the ones that have caught my eye have been: 

- EV ZLX-12P ($349) (max SPL: 126 dB)

- QSC K12 (pretty pricey but damn do these bump.. A friend of mine has these and I’ve worked with them. somebody convince me to spend the extra $$ lol. I know they’re a bit cheaper now that the K12.2 have came out) ($655) (max SPL: 131 dB)

- QSC CP12 (I’m on the fence about these and have heard mixed reviews so I’m not so sure) ($499) (max SPL: 126 dB)

- JBL EON 612 ($349) (max SPL: 126 dB)

- EV EKX-12P (same situation as the K12’s. Pricier but i’ve heard great things.. need some convincing to pay that extra) ($699) (max SPL: 132 dB)

- Mackie Thump12BST (not a huge fan of mackies but i’d consider) ($349) (max SPL: 125 dB)

- Yamaha DBR12 (haven’t heard much about these) ($499) (max SPL: 131 dB)

- JBL PRX412M ($499) (max SPL: 126 dB)

- Avante A12 ($399) (max SPL: 123 dB)

- **** EV ELX200-12P ($499) (max SPL: 130 dB) (as of right now these are my top choice)


I’m purchasing these later today as I have a gig tomorrow so any help would be greatly appreciated!

Travel pay and OT,"Hey all,

I have begun to A1 as a freelancer for a company that puts techs on trains/planes, and this is uncharted territory for me in terms of billing. For a corporate event company with deep pockets, what is the standard?

Do hours spent travelling contribute to OT? For example, even if travel hours are discounted, 3 hours spent travelling before work begins means that I reach OT after 7 hours of work.

X32 Theatre Control,"Hi everyone - I've used an X32 to mix musicals since 2013 but over the years I became frustrated with its scene management: essentially, its scene/snippet functions are not suited to managing lots of DCA assignment cues.  Almost 3 years ago I decided to write some software to simplify DCA assignments on the X32, from there it's grown into an ongoing side project with lots of features for musical theatre mixing.

Back in June I publicly released the software on the Behringer forums and it's been used by sound engineers on both community and professional productions.  Since not everybody in the live sound world checks out the Behringer forums I thought that /r/livesound Redditors may want to hear about it :)

Introducing X32 Theatre Control - allows you to manage control group (DCA) cues, include position and EQ presets and FX assignments in cues, edit cues live from the console, monitor wireless microphones, seamlessly switch backup microphones, control QLab from the console, and more... running on macOS or Windows.  It's free (as in beer), and also works with Midas M32 consoles.

"Too much vocal monitor spoils performance, or, how hot to run the monitors?","Hi, lurker for a while. Amateur SE and musician, I do both live sound and play in bands on my local circuit. 

Recently I ran sound for an outdoor fundraiser show, 5 bands on a beach ranging from a power trio to a six member group fond of instrument swapping and mandolins on loud rock songs. QSL mains and sub, 4 wedges, Yamaha analog mixer: the nicest setup I've mixed on to date. All went very well.

I gave the singer of the headline band, a lady with a stellar voice, great mic technique, and huge presence the monitor mix we worked out in soundcheck. Her voice came out super timid, so much so that I had a trouble getting her voice up over the band in the FOH mix. Eventually, out of options, I turned her monitor _down_ to try and force her to sing a bit harder, and that seemed to do it: she started letting rip again and it was vastly better. Fortunately I got this done early in the set. I've since done a couple of shows myself with quiet monitors and I've had to belt to hear myself, and people have commented on how much my vocals have improved!

So is this too-much-vocal a known thing to the monitor mixers here? Does this happen a lot with amateur bands? Or, more likely, the fault is mine: maybe I was just running the monitors too hot overall? Hard to judge when the bands tell you everything is fine. What else should I have done?",t2_79w1e,3,1

Live sound questions for a two-piece rock duo,"Hey everybody,

I hope I'm in the right place to ask this, I play guitar in a two man rock group I formed with my friend. Right now we just play cover songs in his bedroom for fun a few times a week, but I'm interested in getting us to sound the best we can because if we get good enough I wouldn't mind looking into live performance for fun at open mics or what have you.

My guitar signal is coming out of a VOX AC15C1 combo amp and he is playing his electronic drums through a small set of stereo speakers with a subwoofer. 

It sounds alright as is, but the way I hear it I seem to hear myself, and him, but it doesn't really sound like one overall mix. The two sounds don't seem to layer with one another and sound disjointed, even though we're playing in time with one another.

I realize there are infinitely many factors to consider when looking at live sound or audio in general (size/acoustics of the room, amp placement, volume levels, guitar tone and drum sounds, etc.) This could be just an issue with how we currently have the amp/speakers set up in the room, but I was curious to see if any of you have some quick tips or advice for making a two-piece band like ours sound as good as it can in a bedroom environment (or possibly beyond)

Anyone work with the Soundcraft Ui24r? Am I being an idiot for considering not accepting more jobs using it?,"I just got done mixing a small festival recently running FoH and Monitors off of a Soundcraft Ui24r. The DBX FRS2 integration is amazing, but I’ve found that the mixer control surface itself will randomly restart during the middle of performances and force me to wait about a minute before being able to make any adjustments in the mixer. The touch screen also became much less accurate after using it for a while. The menu for Aux masters is a few clicks away so if I need to get to them fast to fix any issues it’s impossible. The same goes for all the faders because it can only display so many without scrolling over to the rest. The meters are hard to read and determine what sources is causing an issue in comparison to other mixers.

I personally feel like this is dangerous in the case of feedback - to me my number one priority is the safety of the musicians and crowd, and this system makes it very hard to fix any problems as quick as I should. Is that a valid reason to not accept a gig in any of your opinions?

The PA system is installed and working, but the PTT mic functionality is not very loud. Does anyone have suggestions on how I could make it louder? Maybe I could attach a preamp to it? Open to any ideas and how you would implement them since I'm not experienced with sound or electrical systems. Since the sirens on the PA System are loud, I think the PTT functionality might just need an input boost, but there's probably many ways to address this

Also I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how they would hook up the ""Radio"" functionality to the car stereo. This feature is mentioned in the online docs for this PA system but I was wondering if anyone had further suggestions or ideas. Would be a nice-to-have feature, but not critical, especially if the hookup is challenging.

As for the cons, it's not very rider friendly at all, we're sceptical about its reliability as we'd had issues with Outline stuff before, and they sound average at best.

So what I'm asking is: do any of you have suggestions for line array tops that offer good horizontal coverage (around 120°) and isn't that much more expensive than the Mantas, while being more reliable and rider friendly?

Also, if you've got any good arguments as for why they shouldn't just go with the cheapest offer (as the management often like to do) but rather spend a couple thousand bucks extra on a mid-tier d&amp;b rig or something, I'd like to hear it and present it to them! :) ",t2_9lunj6d,3,1

Stereo Outputs are too quiet through my mixer?,"My setup is very limited (largely due to being poor college student). I also apologize if my question and terminology is very nooby.

I recently bought a new mixer -- **Soundcraft Signature 12 MTK** for multi-track recording and live performances with my friend's band. I have all the instruments setup for recording and jamming (as equipment test for our gig in 2 weeks), monitor sounds good, but when we stereo output our pair speakers, **Peavey Pr 12 NEO,** the volume is so quiet is hardly audible. Even with faders at every channel and master at max. Even pushing the gains to max is still too quiet (plus with clipping). At this max'd output volume, it will be drowned out at a 400 sq ft room with 20 people talking at talking levels. Our amps output a louder sound, but I don't want to risk damaging the amps. I have tested my mixer with some my university's Yamaha speakers (they have XLR inputs, if that helps) at school events and they output volume just fine.

Help so we can have an audible sound for our gig? D:

What parts can I swap in ULX beltpacks?,"I preface this by saying I've done a little bit of work in ULX body packs before - new switches, connectors, battery terminals and the like, but I am not an electrical engineer.

I've got all my ULX M1 beltpacks boxed up to send back to Shure for the rebate, (replacing with ULXD) but we've still got a  handful of J1 band ULX that we're hanging on to for now. Today one of my J1 beltpacks decides to stop transmitting audio - solid signal on the receiver, but no audio. Power cycle the bodypack and it comes back for a few minutes, but then cuts out again, leaving us with nothing but a quiet buzz.

Since I've got a solid RF signal, I'm inclined to believe it's not a problem with the radio. Shure says they're going to destroy the M1 gear when they get it back anyway; is there a part I can swap in from the M1's to get the J1 pack back in service?

Wireless mic trouble in stadium,"Our marching band has a tight budget, so we got a cheap four-channel wireless system. Already planning to upgrade, but before we spend money I'm trying to figure out what our problem is.

At our last performance in a high school stadium, three of the four mics failed. They had fresh batteries, worked earlier that day, and when we tested immediately after in a different part of the school grounds, they all worked fine. But during the show, the receiver didn't get any signal from three of the mics. The performers said they were all on (they've done this before so I believe them). Each one uses a different fixed frequency (in the mid-200's). Receiver is on the sidelines and performers are up to 100ft away (some are 20-30 ft away). This had also happened in a high school basketball court (same 3 mics not working).

Could there be some PA interference that would cause them to not get any signal at all to the receiver? Something else? What should I look for in a mic system upgrade?

Response to feedback from bands,"Im employed at a music venue/bar 2-3 nights a week.
Ive been here almost 6 months now and It's probably the best place I get to mix.

We usually do 2-3 bands per night 8pm-2:30am 5 nights a week depending on the booking but because it's not really a dedicated music venue we rarely do soundchecks as many of the bands have been playing here for quite some time and it wouldn't be as cost effective for the business. 


The manager is happy with my work, the other techs though not often here while I'm working like my mixing so far and the bar staff are appreciative that I mix a bit quieter than the other guys when I can. I usually get some positive comments from bands about to go on about the previous band at least one a fortnight so I'm pretty confident in doing a decent job 


That said I occasionally get comments about my sound that come in one of the following general forms.

-""man you gotta pump those vocals/bass/kick ay"" 10-15 seconds after we start.

These people tend to be trying to be genuinely helpful and know enough to know what I'm doing in the first place but not enough to know that the first minute of any band in this place is going to sound significantly worse than at the 10 minute mark.

-""hey I can't hear (name of band member I don't remember)""

These tend to be older friends of a specific band member whose only comment is about the person they know. I check to make sure I'm still happy with the level and clarity of their (usually) voice but to some degree I think they're being influenced by their relationship with one person and preference over a better overall sound.

-A general comment about how either the whole thing or a specific instrument/person sounds one of two things, either muddy, washed out or occasionally 

Again I usually check whatever comment is made, whether or not the singer has started swallowing the mic or if the guitarist has smashed on some distortion and that my reverbs/delays are under control etc.


My biggest issue Ive had so far is when a friend or SO or something from one of the band members tells them what they think about the sound in the vein of one of the vague above formats or something else artsy and 'descriptive'. I feel like they think they're being helpful, and honestly I appreciate the effort. That said i just don't know how they expect me to incorporate the vauge comments of their girlfriend who played accoustic guitar in high school and works at a movie theatre sitting in the back corner.

Headworn mics for Children's/Youth Theater," 

I'm the A/V guy for a small local children's theater (grades 1-9). For each show, we try to mic anywhere from 10-12 kids (who will be trading off mics once and awhile between scenes). We've invested in \[5\] Audio Technica System 10 systems with PRO 92cW-TH headworn microphones. I've had very good look with them and love the sound (as well as the 'miniature' size of the mic, since it works well with the kids smaller faces). The other 6 or 7 systems I use are kind of a mix and lower quality (although some are old shure systems). During the first few seasons, we found out very quickly that kids don't take care of their mics, and we were buying replacements left and right. I ended up taking a chance on some cheap/crappy Pyle mics, just because they were like $20 a piece. (Yes, I know you get what you pay for.) The sound is TERRIBLE - to no surprise - mainly because no matter where the mic is placed, it picks up breathing. So, my question is, is there a decent headworn mic out there that anyone would suggest for a children's theater (and not the big ol' headgear mics)? Or am I just going to have to drop $100+ each time a mic goes out?

Note: The suggestions can either be for full mic systems, or just headworn mics minus the system. And again, it's not necessarily professional-grade, as this is more of a non-profit effort, and the venue is usually only a couple hundred people a night.  I appreciate any help!!",t2_jxido,1,1

I like the sound of both of these cabinets, I probably prefer the tonality of the 3-way (PRX) a little bit more, but I also like the larger HF driver in the 2-way (SRX). They look to be around the same price point for the pair, with similar SPL output levels and similar coverage pattern. The SRX is significantly smaller though, which could prove convenient.

Is the cheapest 'egg carton' foam as good as any for acoustic treatment,"My band just released an EP recorded in pretty poor conditions (a granny flat with lino floors) and crap gear, but we just wanted to get the songs out so we were not too fussy. We have started writing for our next record and have already started collecting significant upgrades in recording equipment, which already makes a world of difference may I say. 

This time around we are looking to record live to try to capture something we feel we missed last time around. We want to put amps around the house to isolate them, have our frontman sing in a different room etc. and we want to build acoustic screens of sorts (sort of like an office divider made of wood), about 2m high and 3m wide, to put around the drums to dampen the sounds of the room and cancel any bleed from guitars in the room. We did some rough calculations and if we get the $1 per 30x30cm foam off eBay, we'd need a little over 50 to cover the surface but at the point that we are building this whole panel, i don't want to cheap out on the surfacing if it's going to make a significant difference getting better stuff.

It's key to know the drums will be recorded (mainly with dynamic mics) in a bedroom which is probably 6x3m and carpeted with just general room stuff in it i.e bed, computer.

One Single Ramsa,"Is what I had for a P. A. today. And a mix wiz. No outboard gear, mono, 1 eq, 7 VERY talented musicians, a bad room, and a TON of fun. The gig was in my home port so I checked out the room yesterday before my gig today. I nearly cried. The musicians are world class, and this was a celebration of a hospital being around for 90 years. Sooooooo, the fun part:
It was a church like set up with the ugliest ramsa 12x2 box hanging way up in the ceiling pointing downish. I reference it- it works. Ok, good. How about the miniature delays further back under a balcony? Nope. Traced every cable start to finish, sent a signal from the one speaker that worked (known good source), still nothing. They looked like rear speakers in a goofy surround sound system for someone's apartment. There's a 1400 watt amp powering them.... Likely grenaded them 20 years ago haha! So anyway, I test the first gen Mix Wiz and unsurprisingly it works flawlessly. (damn those little buggers were/are great). Every last piece of it. Yay! Alright let's eq this room a bit. Yep. Bad. But workable. Did you know Ramsa made a 32 band eq? Me either. It worked. Good enough haha! Ok let's check out your monitors. How many can I do? 4? Great. Oh, it's all 1 mix. Oh, it USED to be passive but we blew them all up so now we have 3 different powered wedges we plug the 1/4 inch speaker cable into and then just turn them WAY down because it seems too loud. Then we daisy chain all the wedges off of that.

Holy shit. I explain to the house tech how fucked up that is. He explains some of the powered wedges act funny.... I explain why hahaha! (instead of running a regular signal to them, they've been using a speaker cable outta a power amp, into the powered wedge's input because that's how the PA was installed) 

OK forget that nonsense. I'm gonna eat up some channels on the snake and use a few barrels and turnarounds to get proper signal into your powered wedges and have more than 1 mix.

Anyway long story short, I did the gig today under arguably some of the worst conditions I could've dreamed about and it went off without any problems and actually sounded great. I couldn't believe it. One damn speaker. It made me feel fuckin great because I'm so used having nice equipment to work with that this one made me WORK for something reasonable. It was a shit load of fun, the musicians were happy, the house tech learned a few tricks today, and I got the opportunity to be challenged and still have fun. I have to give credit to the venue crew for providing me with equipment that aside from the delays, actually worked perfectly. I'd rather have working shitty gear, than broken nice gear.

PA System and Mixers for House Shows,"Hey, I'm a total newbie to live sound and I've been doing a lot of digging, but as result, have even more questions now.

For live sound set-up at house shows, I'm trying to invest in a PA system and a mixer.

What does powered/unpowered mixers and speakers mean? Do i have to get a powered mixer &gt; powered speaker and vice versa?

Does a sound system such as the Harbinger M60 Portable PA serve as an all-in-one kinda system that comes with PA's and a mixer?

Help networking using an iMac as a WiFi dongle w/ Midas M32r,"Hi friends,  thought this was an Apple setting so I posted in the Apple tech support forum but had no answers.  Totally didn't think to X-post it here.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, thanks for the help!!  PS - anyone have any experience using a cheaper tablet like an Amazon Fire or similar for running the M32-Mix app?  That way I can just buy a dedicated cheap tablet and leave it with the mixer or buy a few of them for the band so we don't have to use our personal iPads/iPhones.  Cheers!

  
\-------

 Searched all audio forums high and low; cannot figure out how to accomplish my goal: getting my iPad to talk to my console. Using a Mac Mini as internet connection (via WiFi), ProTools interface (via USB) and remote control for my Midas M32R console (via Ethernet). While connected to my WiFi network, the iPad should theoretically be able to find my Midas and act as a 2nd remote (for adjusting the board on the fly while playing an instrument while not seated at the mixing desk).

I have the Midas communicating remotely with the Mac (using Midas M32 Mix app) which has internet access, but I cannot get the iPad to find the board (via the Midas M32-Q app). The app allows me to type in the boards IP address, but when I put in the same IP that allows the Midas app on the Mac to communicate with the console, it will not connect.

I have also tried using the IP of the iMac, and assigning a manual IP to the Ethernet out port. I figure it’s some setting in the macs network settings, but idk.

SMPTE to MTC Conversion,"TL;DR, does anyone have any inventive ways to convert from SMPTE (XLR) to MTC (5-pin DIN)?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So.. One off gig coming up, SD7 isn't available and we are moving to SD5.

&amp;#x200B;

Typically for this gig, SMPTE is taken in through one of the SD Racks on stage, then looped/routed from a local output on each console, and then into the dedicated SMPTE input on the console.

&amp;#x200B;

As we know the SD7 is the only SD console with this dedicated SMPTE I/O, and all the other SD consoles instead offer only MTC on 5-pin DIN (MIDI) connectors.

&amp;#x200B;

We have visited the trusty Rosendahl Mif 4 boxes, but these are kind of pricey for a one off ($800USD).. Though I'm considering going for the Mif because it's sort of the standard.

&amp;#x200B;

We have used in the past Avid SYNC HD, but these dropped the first few frames (not the end of the world), and are a full rack space unit, and also much more expensive than the MIF4

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently considering a hardware option in the form of a pair of MOTU micro express, as these are cost effective, and sort of fit in a 1535 workbox (still 1/2RU, but maybe I could find room in my 1535)

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, Figure 53 (Qlab) make a little piece of software called LockStep, and while this seems like a no brainer, I'm concerned that I'd need a dedicated laptop to run this, which makes it less cost effective than the MOTU box. My chief concern with running it on the existing machine is that the only computer at FOH that's available is running ProTools Ultimate, and I'm concerned that PT will take control of all the connected I/O and not allow signal to route to/from LockStep.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've covered this pretty in depth, but I thought that maybe the awesome folks in  r/livesound might know something I don't.

DIY Waves Server,"Hi gang,

I have a small project I wanted to work on for some time and just wanted to know if anyone else on here had a similar idea or thought. (Rookie post incoming)

I'm big into my pc gaming rigs and in general computer architecture. I was wondering has anyone ever built their own standalone server for running waves? I see they've reciently launched presale for a new ""mini style sound grid server"" in 2019 where they offer an i5 machine for 800bucks @0.8ms latency @96k.

I have loads of components sitting at home and would love to build a small micro atx and maybe invest 200-300 for small form factor motherboard and case.

Am I really naive in thinking that these machines can be built quite simply? Would there be massive latency issues by running waves native? Would I need to buy something like the Etherface or would it be possible to just run it on a LAN at the same almost 0.8ms latency with enough ram, processing power? 

The idea would be to make something that's rack mountable like that but with the added benefit of it being a Windows 10machine and possibly formatted to run Mac on the partitioned drive for offline show editing e.t.c. A kind of super work computer capable of being relyable for either running my waves plugins live/cue lab e.t.c.

Custom Ear Protection,"Hello all, I'm a 23 year old performing and recording musician. I've always worn ear protections since I was in middle school band as a percussionist.

Let's talk about Office Pics,"A few years ago, we had a problem. We wanted a discussion-oriented subreddit, but the way that Reddit works means that easily-digestible content like pictures, which you can upvote as you scroll past rather than reading a text post and diving into discussion, tend to get upvoted and dominate the front page. Photos don't tend to generate much in the way of discussion, and seeing nothing but a wall of people's pictures of consoles gets repetitive.

Our solution was the weekly Office Pics Thread, the purpose being to clean up our front page and make it more focused on discussion, while offering a place for people to share their gig pictures, and for people to look at them, without having to ban them entirely.

This ended up being fairly effective. Signal to noise ratio improved, and I didn't have to swing the Mod Hammer around (I always prefer voluntary solutions to problems over authoritarianism).

A few years later, and the problem seems to have returned. People are posting their office pics as top-level submissions, and when they get called on it they say ""but nobody reads the Office Pics thread!""

We've added a lot of subscribers in the last few years, probably ten times as many people are reading the subreddit today as we had at the time we introduced the Office Pics thread. So, I think it's time to have a fresh discussion about what kind of subreddit we are and what changes, if any, need to be made. Like I said, I prefer voluntary solutions to problems over swinging the Mod Hammer and imposing changes on people who don't want them.

Dave Rat's AES presentation,"Anyone else catch it? He hasn't released the research formally yet but I'll summarize because it's so damn interesting... He started with slides from Coachella, talking about the spacing of the first delay ring, and how it was perfect coverage during setup and tuning. When the sun was setting and the sunlight was shining right into the arrays, he notices gaps in the horizontal coverage between delay towers. Once the sun went down he noticed overlap in the coverage again. That same day, he noticed how hot the tops of his road cases were getting in the sunlight, and made the connection.
After some bench tests he realized that direct sunlight heats the horn material in a way that causes the adjacent, very hot layer of air to refract the sound away from the walls of the horn, similar to how propagation paths bend upward at the hot layer of air above an audience on a cool night. This has the effect of narrowing the coverage pattern, causing the inconsistencies he heard.
He then turned the presentation over to a scientist from Italy who did controlled tests in a lab. The effect was reproduced and studied on a variety of loudspeakers, for which data was presented. Fascinating stuff. Dave suggested that painting horns white would reduce the effects, and hypothesized that the white system at the Hollywood Bowl would likewise be less susceptible.
What's really compelling about this, to me, is that it was discovered not in the bowels of a lab with sophisticated test equipment but just by having experience and awareness and great ears. Hopefully he'll publish the data soon. ",t2_1plyg5jc,135,1

My budget for this is around $250, so I'm not sure what that can get me in terms of quality. Just in case this didn't warrant a completely new post, I also posted this question in the No Stupid Questions thread. Thanks in advance!

Pat: Hey, hey , did you hear that high pitch ""SKREEE"" sound all night long?  

Me: {looking concerned and confused} No I did not, did you mean the feedback when the singer held the mic low and it was pointed at the monitor?  

Pat: No, it was a constant high pitched screech, it was happening the whole show, My brother has hearing issues, but I was blessed with super hearing and often hear stuff the sound guy missed.  

Me: The whole show? No, I wasn't hearing anything like that at all, you said it was a screech? Like feedback? {knowing that there was no such sound I am now slightly amused and wondering what this dude was hearing}  

Pat: Oh man, I would have come up and told you but I was just here for the last 20 minutes of the show. It was a mechanical sound near the back of the room, sorta like machinery running. You really have to walk around and hear the whole room instead of sitting there.  

Me: Wow, I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I was walking the room most of the night, but I must have missed that noise. So where were you hearing the noise? {I point to the back corner of the room where the ice machine is located}  

Pat: Yeah it was the worst back there! See you know what I'm talking about it. That computer thing you have should be able to filter out that kind of noise from the music. {points to the laptop I'm using for a control surface}  

Me: Well I appreciate your feedback and unfortunately they haven't really come up with a way to filter that sort of noise out. I was looking at the meters throughout the night and can assure you that if I saw what you describe coming out of the PA I would have done my best to fix it. Are you still hearing the noise?  

Pat: Yeah, and it's terrible. Can you just shut the sound system off? It's giving me a headache {mumbles} damn my amazing ears.  

Me: The system is off sir. I really appreciate your feedback on our performance and will double check everything at our next show. You might want to go double check the back of the room and see if you can still hear the noise.  

Pat: {frustrated} Of course I can hear the noise! I can't believe that you can't hear it!

My concern is I can work well with analogue boards and I know the x32 like the back of my hand but I’d like to learn more boards so when I land a tour I can do it with full confidence. 

Is there anyway to get hands on experience with several boards just so I can get the layout of them. Like I have principals down very well and mix 3-5 nights a week but almost exclusively on an x-32. So if I showed up to a venue with an Allen and heath I wouldn’t be super confident and quick with it.

Setting limiters on amps that don't have have built in DSP?,"System tech is my weekness when it comes to journey as an audio engineer, so pardon the silly question. I have some older crest amps in my venue that don't have any built in DSP/presets for boxes...literally just has two trim knobs.

I have all the box tunings/crossover settings from the manufacture programmed in, but I have idea how to properly set the limiters to protect our speakers. I've seen on some newer, higher end amps you can enter the max voltage/wattage, but on the Ashley the limiter threshold is relative to the input/output amount, so it's pretty much been a guessing game, and clearly they haven't been set right because we are having to repair a few boxes.

wireless mic system - battery powered receiver??,"Alright my peeps. I'm on a mission to create an almost entirely wireless battery powered PA system. I'll add my setup after the question.

Does anyone have success with a wireless mic system with a battery powered receiver? Alesis Miclink system is the best option I've managed to find thus far. There are many, many wireless options from off-brand companies on Amazon where the receiver is a small unit that connects via 1/4, but I have little confidence the quality of the microphone would be anywhere near equal to any of my dynamics (sm58, sennheiser e835, Blue encore 200). There are, of course, better name-brand wireless options but the receiver unit won't run on battery.

Questions/comments/opinions appreciated

Setup:

\-MAINS: JBL EON One Pro (battery powered)

\-or Bose S1 Pro (battery powered). I use it for monitor if Im using the JBL for the mains. Venue size dependant

\-Samson expedition escape if I'm using the Bose S1 for main (battery powered)

\-TC helicon mic mechanic (battery powered)

\-Zoom AC-3 acoustic pedal (battery powered)

\-Xvive wireless guitar system (if you've never heard of it I HIGHLY recommend)

So, as you can see, other than the XLRs running into the mains I only have ONE xlr running from the mic to the pedal. ZERO power cables. If there was some system to make the mic wireless as well, my setup would be complete.",t2_gzuzj,0,1

Different than usual question: How can I setup this audio art installation?,"I have to do the sound for an art installation at a leather tannery event. A guy will paint leather with tannery related equipment, and I'll record and playback the machine pictured on the leather. 

[Pictures of the venue](https://imgur.com/a/UneykMM)

Instead of paintings like those, there will be cow leather painted and hung to the walls, and no more than 5 pieces will be ""sounded"".

My questions: 

* I'd like to have a stereo sound for each piece. **What speakers should I use?** And how can I make them as unintrusive as possible?

* **How can I position them to be as directional as possible?** The sound shouldn't drown out everything else, and when standing in front of a painting, you should hear mainly (not necessarily only) the related sounds.

* **What mixer or audio interface should I use** to drive the 8-10 channels from my laptop (using Max) to the speakers?

There is a budget, but I have to give them an estimate of what it would cost, and I'd prefer to do it as not expensive as possible (not using the word ""cheap"" consciously, I don't want to do a sloppy job for the sake of saving money).

How to keep motivated? / Is it normal to doubt your career choice?,"I am fresh out of a sound school and have been working in this industry for 7-8 months. I mainly take DJ/club night gigs right now, shadow as much as possible and take more challenging gigs when they are available. I hear word from some of my mentors and friends in the industry that I am a good worker and get enough jobs to fill my schedule.

Some days I feel like I'm on top of the world and can make it in this industry. But some days I feel like I am stuck. I am only 20 and I know I have plenty of time to figure it out. But I cant shake this feeling of dread. As if what I am doing won't be enough. Some gigs I get paid a flat rate and I dont feel rushed, I go in early and get everything set so it is a smooth night and the artists are happy. But other nights i get paid hourly and I am pressured to do things faster (and sometimes sloppier) as a result.

Presonus studiolive 16r vs rml16ai,"Not very familiar with the presonus family but a friend has asked me to look into these two units. Primary purpose would be a rackmount digital mixer for use with a large outdoor polo event. About 4 mic inputs, two line level. Currently done with an apb monitor board because of the routing flexibility and number of sends. We could get by with the l/r/6-8 auxes in either of these units. 

Due to space constraints not currently looking for a larger control surface and 3u is sort of the limit. The price on both of these along with the local inputs and outputs was kind of what he was interested in. Ability to control the unit remotely from a Windows desktop (remote over internet -&gt; desktop, control from there) in the case of being off-site was also of interest. 

What's the big ""family"" difference between the two? I understand with a board based system they 16r can he used as a stage box. That's not a scenario I can see him using. Can the 16r alone use one of those 8x8 stage boxes? That might come in handy. I also see the rm16ai can get a Dante card - but the 16r cannot? Looking at all of these I'm leaning more towards recommending the rml16ai as I see the ability of Dante/stage box connection as a plus for him in the future - unless I'm missing something?

The other unit I was looking at recommending to him was a behringer x32 but it has way more inputs then needed and a much larger footprint.

Currently pursuing it as a career (trying to get on tour lol).

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Mono vs Stereo: I always prefer to run in stereo, I put certain instruments such as guitars, toms/overheads, keys (stereo), and background vocals in the stereo field; and keep bass, lead vocal, kick/snare in the center. Is this wrong? The owner of one of the companies I work as an A1 for always tells me I'm doing it wrong and should be running live audio in mono, especially outdoors. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Running subs off separate output (NOT piggybacking off of the mains): Same guy from previous question is convinced the best way is to piggyback the subs off of the mains. My preference is to ALWAYS run them off of a separate output, and send only the instruments I want (bass, kick, snare, floor tom, keys), with a crossover eq. Am I crazy?

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Front fills: Mono send off their own output, or piggyback each side off of the L/R mix? 

&amp;#x200B;

4 - Should you RTA your mains and subs for an outdoor gig? And how would one do this with all the ambient noise present (ex = busy city square for city concert series setup)?

I can find most everything on Spotify or Apple Music but most of the track’s starting point needs to be edited. Where is the best place to download popular music that I can edit? I used to torrent a lot of music but I find that cumbersome and I can’t always find the version I want.

Lost a gig :(,"I got the gear list which included an S6L.  I do what I always do, which is to be totally honest about my skills.  I told them I had never used a S6L before but I am familiar with SC48.  These guys said no sorry and took me off the gig, which I realize is their prerogative.

Other companies that know me would have been fine with that. They trust me to figure it out if there's plenty of time before the gig starts.  

Is Avid S6L that crazy to learn?  Every other new platform I've learned on the job site with the pressure on, and been fine.

I feel like that's the only way to learn new consoles, which is to be thrown to the wolves.  Am I wrong?  How else am I ever going to get my hands on a S6L, or any time something new comes out?  It's a goddamn catch 22.

The venue has an M7CL that I was planning on running DANTE into a ProTools rig on my laptop.

Worried about setting up my first gig ever.,"So not only is my little band playing its first gig ever in a few days, as the resident gearhead, I'm also responsible for setting up all the equipment, including PA. I'm worried that it'll either be too loud, or not loud enough. Could I get some advice?

My initial thoughts are to use my Yamaha as monitors, senns as PA, 4x12 aimed backwards for guitar, and bass/vocals through PA. My total setup area is going to be maybe 8x10 ft, so not a lot to work with. Would it be worth using monitors at all with such a small area? 

Many thanks in advance.

This is what I have to work with:

* weird shaped small bar room, fits ~75.
* 4 piece rock band, E guitar, E bass, acoustic drums vocalist.
* MG12XU
* 2x Yamaha Stagepas 300 (8"" PA)
* 2x (maybe 4x) Sennheiser LSP 500 Pro (also 8"" drivers).
* bass and vocalist through PA.
* acoustic drums with a jacked drummer who doesn't know how to play quietly.
* guitar either DI to PA, or 4x12 cabinet.

On Sunday, I had earplugs in and most bands sounded cluttered. Couldn't hear any vocals and I was just completely enveloped by the subwoofers. It was just BOOM WOOSH BOOM WOOSH everytime.

Sound system recommendation for magic shows?,"Hi all - I hope this is the correct subreddit to post this question, but if not, please direct me to the correct subreddit or other subreddits to try, thanks!

I do magic shows at private homes, in catering halls and other venues, and sometimes outdoors. Let's say the size of my crowds are anywhere from 15 people up to about 100 people, so I'm not talking huge crowds. I need a sound system that can be purchased in the U.S. (no international shipping) that comes with a wireless microphone, and also the ability to play music at different parts of my show off of a USB stick and from an iPod. I don't need high fidelity music like a professional DJ, just music for the size of my crowds in addition to the wireless microphone. Additionally, the system can't weight too much or be too large because sometimes I have to carry it up and down stairs when I take the subway instead of my car to some shows.

I have used this sound system for years:
http://floridamagic.bizhosting.com/pas_8000.html

It's starting to get old - the audio from the wireless microphone cuts out at times. Also, this sound system is discontinued, but the new version is here:
http://floridamagic.bizhosting.com/pas_8500_the_ultimate_portable_pa_system.html

That new system weighs in at about 10 pounds, and I wouldn't want something heavier than that. Both system are 100 watts, and cost the maximum I'm willing to pay, $500 (or less) for a quality system that meets my criteria.

Focusrite Scarletts in live vocal processing? Any alternatives?,"Hey folks, wondering if anyone has had experience with this. Apologies if this is the wrong sub for it.

I'm planning a live show which I'm going to run through Ableton. Everything's set to a click/backing track and my plan was to also use the session for vocal processing. Delays that I can automatically trigger at certain points in songs, telephone voicing etc.

However, the last time I did this at a show (albeit using Mainstage) we had to can it because my microphone was feeding back and the engineer said the vocal sounded ""compressed"" even when the vocals were off and I was running the signal unprocessed. This was with the Scarlett 2i4.

I could use a DI box and run the thru into the laptop, but I'm concerned the same problem would happen with the 'wet' signal.

How would it compare with the Behringer k450fx ? I read great reviews of the Behringer which seems to sound very loud for its size. Plus, being pole-mountable is definitively an advantage (I guess I could still position the Carlsbro on a table or stool).

There are even a Mackie SRM150 or a Behringer MPA40BT available on local classified, but they don't have any built-in reverb - and I fear they would be underpowered, and not have enough low-end even for the guitar - so forget the bass / edrums.

Would a behringer eurolive give me better power otherwise? I'd need to find at least a vocal reverb though them which would kick up my budget :(

 I have seen other commenting that one needs at least 300W for use as a mains.  Do you guys think this is true and even for small venues (cafe / pub up to 30 p) one needs a proper powered real PA?

X32 Rack - can you send multiple backing track audio channels direct to it via usb/adat/ethernet etc? whilst also using it for monitoring and FOH,"is it possible to send upto 8 backing track audio channels from my mac direct to an x32 rack?

the band use the x32 rack as both our monitoring and FOH desk and at the moment i have to use a big interface plugged into my mac to get the 8 channels to XLR Outputs and then i have to plug the 8 xlrs into the x32! it’s for backing track that plays alongside the band and i need 8 channels as i separate the track drums/synths/bvs etc.

feel like there must be a way to get all the channels go direct to the x32 whether by usb/ethernet/adat etc?

Can I get away with subless EV EKX-12P for support in secondary room,"The following is the situation: Wedding of 150 people in a set of three rooms connected by wide open ""gates"".

Video guy looking for suggestions on improving my live-concert recording game,"For several years now, I've been shooting concerts for a non-profit that hosts shows a half a dozen or so times a year, all from different venues.  The music spans all genres.  For the big events of the year, we have full multi-track Dante recording support from the venue, so we're able to master the final video to our hearts' content and make everyone happy.  
  
On the flip-side, the other shows throughout the year give us nothing.  They might be in dive bars with analog boards, or if they do have a digital board, they aren't using Dante, making any Dante-specific hardware we have or might acquire useless.  At best, I often get a Tape-Out, or a mirror of the Main-Mix that doesn't sound great because the venue's audio tech is only mixing for the house PA, and it wouldn't be appropriate to poke them every two minutes to adjust something for the sake of our recording.  
  
I want to spend funds specifically to shore up weaknesses in our audio recording for these smaller venues, and am researching what options are out there.  In the past, I've gotten by with limited 2-, 4-, and 6-track recorders from Zoom and Tascam...often mixing the board feed with an ambient mic and maybe another mic or two positioned on key things like drums or a guitar amp.  I could continue to go this route, and upgrade to even bigger portable recorders that give us more tracks from physical inputs, like the Zoom F8n or even the L-20.  That still leaves us the problem of where the hell do we get outputs to fill those other tracks though, if the house board doesn't have any Aux-Outs available.  More ambient mics?  Two-channel splitters we put in-line on specific instruments?  
  
Since a few of our shows are always Dante, I've even thought about picking up a Dante digital snake and some stage splitters we could use for the small venue shows, but the setup and configuration time for that seems like it would be incredibly inconvenient.  Not to mention that we'd have to split all the house channels and that's probably not kosher.  
  
Or maybe the solution is to just keep at it with our current setup, because any money thrown at it would see marginal improvements at best, or complicate it to a level that it would be impractical for the less audio-savvy videographers on our team to use.

Dante Multitrack Recording,"Hello again, r/livesound.
Looking for a tip on using Dante to multitrack record, and have a super simple question, I think.
I volunteer in a shared equipment environment where the IT infrastructure is managed by a university, so access to their stuff is sometimes limited, and Dante being fed by cat5....you get the idea. Plus, the sound board in the venue was jointly purchased by my organization (a church) and the uni.
One oddity, they have our/their/whoevers board (AH GLD-80) using the secondary port in the Dante card, probably not a big deal, just odd.
Anyway, I don't currently have access to whatever gig switch they have the board connected to, but I would like to multi track record. Would this be possible by plugging into the Primary network out from the Dante card? I'm guessing that won't work, and that it might hijack the send from the secondary out port, messing with some of their config since the two outs are just for redundancy if a cat5 run were to fail.

Anybody out there have any advice? Basically I just want to know if I can plug into that primary ethernet out port in the back, and be in business without interfering with their setup.

Audio streaming levels question,"Hey all,

So I work for a small venue that does pro tools multitrack recording of the live shows and we stream the audio and video live online.

Here's the thing. The levels necessary for adequate volume on the streaming sites is crazy high. My main output fader has a comp with -20db threshold and a ton of makeup gain. I am redlining the board output, redlining the streaming software, and the stream is *still* significantly quieter than a Spotify or Youtube track or comparable live stream. 

Is that normal? Should I say fuck it, up the ratio and just compress the hell out of the live stream? I figure that the audio is getting compressed a couple more times between me and the listener and I could just mix for volume. But seeing all this red in my systems is freaking me out. 

What do you folk do for live audio streaming? I really just need to know if it's normal to be compressing streamed audio this much.

Pine Bark Extract for Tinnitus Treatment,"Hey r/livesound long time lurker here and wanted to share some knowledge I was giving about a month ago from a friend involving tinnitus treatment. 

Im 28 and have been a live audio engineer full time for the last 8-9 years now and over the last couple years have started my tinnitus getting worse. My tinnitus is still pretty low - mild I would consider but it was starting to get really annoying when I was trying to go to sleep. A friend told me that he started talking Pine Bark Extract to help him with his tinnitus. He’s in his late 30’s and has been in live sound for the last 20 or so years. So I was curious and got some for my self from a local store. Sure enough after around a week I was starting to notice less and less tinnitus ringing at night.

I’ve been taking it now for about 3 weeks and while my tinnitus isn’t gone completely it has been significantly reduced and almost not noticeable if I have taken a few days off from mixing.

The  pills I got are 250mg by the brand NOW. There are plenty of study’s out there about it with a quick google search if your interested. 

Worth the 20 bucks if you wanna try it out for yourself if you have tinnitus. Hope it helps friends!

We're a four-piece band looking to move to rehearsing with headphones / in-ears, so we're going to use the four aux sends to drive the headphone amp. Each member can dial in as much or as little of each input as they want to hear.

I do run a laptop w/ Logic while we rehearse (both for backing tracks as well as to capture new song ideas) but I think the latency would be too much of a factor. (I haven't actually tried it, though.)

I've found a bunch of 4-aux options, some with integrated FX but not on each individual channel. Figured it can't hurt to ask if such a mixer actually exists, or if we're barking up the wrong tree.

I should also mention that we don't have a huge budget for this, and will certainly be looking to buy used as well. So a $10,000 pro-level digital mixer isn't in our field of view (as much as we'd love for it to be LOL).

aes question,"Hey guys got a question for you lot, 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

on a gig recently and we were using AES now from my understanding you can't passively split AES like analog, 



so here lies my confusion 


setup 



J series driven by d80 amps and a midas pro FOH 


6 lines of tails on a 100m multi so 12 channels of AES if wanted 

;

1Left + Right  2 Sub +Front Fill    3456 where used as analog back up 


multi went to a multi pin connector  SR  which was a 2u box with a ATI distribution dda 212 xlr 
and another 2 veam or multipin connector outs one for SR and one for  SL which in turn was connected and in a daisy chain fashion from one  amp rack to another SR
Same happened to SL from the 2 u rack with the ATI in it 

in each rack at the back was a 6 way passive split box male and female 

Exsample of what I saw SR say 
5 into A was analog and set to anolog and daisy chained down the 4 amp 
1 into C was AES set to digital and daisy chained 

Seemed to have been feed from a multi pin connector out into the next amp rack which was another 4 amp and so on so forth  

If you know D80s you’ll know what I mean 


I get all this but this mean you can passively split AES 

the ATI  DDA-212XLR has , 2 in 12 out, so I'm guessing it was used just for clocking 


what am I missing here any advice would be great

Wireless Microphone Coverage Solution,"Hello everyone. This isn't exactly my area of expertise so I was hoping that someone could help with a suggestion.

I'm trying to get wireless microphone coverage for a fairly extensive outdoor/indoor area. The speaker will be walking with a microphone around an \~10,000 sq. ft. outdoor area and an indoor hallway \~200ft. deep. The last time I did this we deployed three UA874 and a HA-8089 Helical shooting down the hallway and used modified UA221s (as is Shures suggestion on their support) to use the four antenna on a UA844 DA. This ended up not working and we had one paddle covering the entire outdoor area and the single helical for the indoor. All things considering it ended up OKAY with dropouts starting about 100' down the hallway and a few further upstage in the outdoor area. It gets extremely crowded as well which makes it all more difficult to predict after testing where problems will occur.

Pro2c / DL251 Dropouts during shows,"Hey Team

Long story short i used to directly run 3 cat5e cables from my the aes50 ports on the back of the Pro2c to my DL251 stagebox with a roughly 60m run and everything in my life was great.

But this was a much simpler time.

The cables were pretty snagged and not in great condition but it just so happened the venue spent a lot of money on having RJ45 patch pannels around the venue for each with 4 connectors

Being that the cat6 cabling for all these new patch panels eventually all end up at FOH control, being the young whippersnapper i am, I thought that i could go from the 3 aes50 ports on the DL251 using cat 6, into 3 connectors on the patch pannel, which then end up at a patch pannel at FOH, and then from that patch pannel into the back of the 3 aes50 ports on the desk.

So i've been having a great time mixing a couple of shows since we've done this, but i've started to notice that every couple of minutes, the green port indicator light turns to red, then to green, then to red, then to green in what can only be described as a rhythmic pattern of hellish uncertainty. Like really strangely dipping in and out of sync for a good 10 seconds then everything is green again

No actual audio dropouts during the show, just the ports but i didn't want to pull up a red port indicator to incite the fear of god into a touring TM so i can't investigate further, and i was just only using inputs 1-8 and outputs 1-2 and 13,14,15 and16.

I was led to believe the ports refer to channel count i.e

1 is 1 to 24 and outputs 1-8

2 is 25 to 48 and outputs 8-16

3 is Redundant for either

not sure if this is the case or it actually carries clock data?

Anyways

I am severely worried that having these patch panels even with cat6 is causing some mad stuff to go on, and that on the bigger shows with bigger channel counts if this happens i am going to look very silly and lose a lot of audio.

Looking v desperately for help/ knowledge as i am sweating making my way through the midas manuals

Feels like i'm about to be schooled on points of failure but would be great to know if anyone has had this problem before?

 or if the patch panels should make a difference or not, pretty sure the whole signal is cat 6 as well but would using a cat5e in the chain cause some drama?

Wireless packs interfering with each other,"Our guitar player had gotten a new wireless guitar Shure QLX-D to get out of the older Sennheiser that was in the 600mhz.

I was doing Wireless Workbench workups on gigs(we usually play in fairly rural places anyway) and it was still happening and I was starting to pull my hair out...more than it is already coming out.

Two (hopefully) quick questions,"Hi,

I've been trying to find answers via Google to these questions all morning, but have had no luck, so I decided to come ask reddit. 

I'm not working on a *live* setup, just one for home use, but I think you all might be able to help me out.

I recently decided to set up a home audio system and bought some old audio gear off Craigslist. I'm connecting a few different audio devices (CD player, FM tuner, computer, etc.) to a Mackie MS 1202 mixer because I want to be able to listen to multiple audio sources at once (otherwise I would just use a home audio receiver). Ideally I will take the output from the mixer to a Yamaha A-1000 amp and then to my speakers. So, question one:

1) According to the manual, the mixer outputs at +4dBu (1.23V). The amp has an input sensitivity of 150mV. Is it okay to input a much higher voltage like this into the amp? Do I need an attenuator to take the voltage down a bit?

And the other question:

2) The mixer has 1/4"" TS outputs and the amp has RCA inputs. Can I simply buy some adapters to change the 1/4"" TS to RCA and then use an RCA cable or would it be better to use a dedicated 1/4"" to RCA cable? Would using the adapter cause any loss in sound quality?

"Compartments for 19"" rack drawers","Hey folks!   


As a live tech here in Germany I have to carry a lot of stuff with me.   
That is ok with tools and cables but what really annoyes me is carrying small components like components for repair work (resistors, capacitors, solder, small connectors, etc.) because I am an amp and guitar tech also and it does happen that I have to repair stuff live.   
And because I cannot possibly know what I may need I carry a lot, and I mean A LOT, of small components with me.   


I am looking for advice how to sort and store them without too much effort. I love to use 19"" racks and I do so with tools and lab gear, so I'd like to use the 19"" format for storaging as well.   


Are there any solutions for that problem? Google didn't really help.   


I'd also like to hear how you deal with that or do you have completly other solutions?

Need advice for speakers/sub/mixer for dj events and hosting live musicians,"Was told this was the place to ask this!

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the market to buy a set of speakers, a sub, and a mixer. I am open to using passive speakers, buying amps, crossover, etc if there isn't a powered speaker, powered sub, mixer combo that works.

&amp;#x200B;

I need a setup that can be used for small-mid size events. (20 people to 200/300)

Used for DJing styles of music where pure loudness doesn't do much. Need a clean/crisp stereo image.

Was looking into the EV ZLX 15""s. 90%+ of the reviews seemed like it fit what I wanted and with a sub would provide enough umpf and a great clear sound. Would love to hear feedback on that.

Sub doesn't need to be overpowering, just reliable. Was told a JBL 18"" sub was solid with the 2 speakers (do not know the name, open to suggestions and feedback)

Mixer does not need to be amazing. I was looking into the Midas MR18. It is above the price point I wanted, for sure, but it seems pretty brilliant. I was using the Mackie ProFX12v2 12-Channel Professional FX Mixer with USB previously and it seemed okay. When using it for live instruments/audio, it seemed like there was a small range where I could hear it. Too much lower on the gain and it wouldn't come through, too much higher and it cut hard without much space in between. I am more than content going back to that mixer if you guys don't see a problem with it and I just need to get better at using it.

Then lastly the stands for each individual thing or any other pieces I might need. If I can get a solid, rugged, decent amount of time lasting, clear sounding set up with enough loudness for the size events I'm looking at, I am flexible with the price. I do not need to go crazy though.

gear recommendation,"Hey guys and gals. Just a quick backround of what I am trying to do before my question. I am designing a rig with a QL5 and the EAW radius line.

On larger shows where I have video records and delays and front fill and backstage monitors, I tend to run out of the 8 matrices that the QL5 provides.

Shure BLX vs GLX-D Advanced (or other budget options?),"I'm looking for a new wireless microphone system to recommend for a low-budget operation. We typically use 11 mics per show and 2 handhelds, 8 of which are aging and also affected by the 600MHz spectrum reallocation.

As for the other 3, 1 of them is a 2000 series Audio-Technica that happened to be I band so isn't affected (the rest were D Band), and the remaining 2 are new Shure BLX systems we bought last year. (A-T hadn't updated their line in a long while, and when they finally did they made a new connector that seemingly isn't compatible with any mics they don't make themselves...)

The BLX systems seem nice enough, better than the old systems for sure, but the cheaper materials and the non-removable yet flexible antennas makes me nervous about their longevity. They also seemed quite hot sound-wise last year, though I'm still thinking there's something on our end we're missing on that front (planning to do some experimentation regarding that gain issue this Thanksgiving before audition time to see if it improves..) All in all they work well enough, but we want them to last as long as we can. I think I can get away with pushing a higher-end offering if they'll work better or last longer, but there's no way we can jump up to a QLX/ULX or something that costly.

I was then looking to see if Shure offered a mid-market option. And they do, but it was a 2.4GHz system, and I quickly dismissed this. However their new ""Advanced"" system is causing me to give it another look. They claim to handle up to 11 channels, and if we keep BLX for part of our setup the thought is we could have 6 or so running on GLX reliably. This would allow us to have more RF spectrum to work with to coordinate our other mics as we tour around.

Those systems appear to be better made, the battery system also looks to be a huge convenience (never having to worry about batteries dying in show or convincing someone to go running to Walmart for more again, with time remaining indicators and a rechargeable spare right in the receivers), and they'll never be affected by future FCC spectrum changes. But that said, at the end of the day they have to work, and while we're mostly performing away from dense Wi-Fi areas, I don't want there to be a major problem with the many wireless devices our team, actors, and audience uses (tech crew often sits in audience area)...

Our tech setup is somewhere around 40-50' from the stage (our snake is 50' long so it shouldn't ever be much further back than that). Again we sit in the audience and having the antennae clear the audience has been an issue before with UHF, and I wonder if 2.4 will make that worse...

Has anyone tried this using the GLX-D-Adv. frequency manager with the stock antennae? I would expect it to work with the paddles because they're directional, but because of our quick-setup touring and budget-focused nature, adding the time and cost expenses of setting up paddle antennae right up by the stage probably wouldn't be worth it.

I'm also interested if there are other options anyone may recommend in that sort of price range. Right now I'm still leaning toward just pushing to get more BLX systems because it's still cheaper and doesn't have 2.4G problems. But if there's a better (but still cost-practical) way I'd love to hear it. Thanks for any info!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR -- We are replacing our mic systems, BLX in early testing had some problems and concerns but not terrible, is GLX-D Adv. worth the upgrade or will it cause even more problems? And is there a better option to consider? Thanks.",t2_jdq9m,2,1

Subwoofer Shopping - Help me spend my money!,"Fellow sound guys and gals,
I'm ready to upgrade the Carvin powered subs I've been using for my bar gigs. I've narrowed it down to two options: either the EV ELX200-18SP or the JBL VRX918SP.

The subs will primarily be used when I'm running sound for bar bands, with occasional DJing and drum monitor use as well. 

Here's my main criteria (in order of importance):

- **Sound quality (and SPL output)**
My goal is to be able to cover as many seats as possible with only the gear in my SUV (Highlander). I assume the JBL beats out the EV by a little bit, but do you guys think the size difference is worth the difference in sound quality and output?

- ‎**Size**
I can fit the JBLs, but it's not very comfortable. The EVs fit very nicely. 

- ‎**Reliability and stability**
I trust the JBL name better than EV, but I'm sure EV cabinets are very reliable. I do like the simplicity of JBLs amp. I'm not interested in any sort of DSP or even multiple ins/outs. I'm running the subs from a matrix on my console, so I can do any necessary processing there. In terms of stability, the EV only weighs 64 lbs, which is very convenient for transport, but I plan on upgrading my tops to the SRX815P soon, which weighs only a few pounds less. Considering that the EV is so light and has such a small footprint, should I be worried about putting the SRX on it with a pole?


Here's my secondary criteria (also in order of importance. This stuff is nice but not as important as the stuff I listed above)

- **Price**
The VRX costs a lot of money. Is it worth the increase over the EV?

- **LF Extension**
The VRX goes a lot lower than the EV. (@ -3dB, 34 vs 47Hz)

- **Powercon**
I like the Powercon in/out on the VRX. 

So, in conclusion, what do you guys think about the two models? Which one would be my money be better spent on? I appreciate any and all insight. Thanks!

Shure PSM 200 In Ear Monitor System - Best Sound?,"Hi! I am a singer in an Oasis tribute band and have recently bought a Wireless In Ear Monitor system, the Shure PSM 200. The earphones I use are the MEE Audio M6 2nd Generation. My question is, what is the best way to set them up so I get the most clearest and best sound out of it in a live concert/gig environment? So far we have been kind of guessing and haven't known what to tell the sound guys how I need it so it's been a bit hit and miss so far.

The problem I have is sometimes the sound just completely cuts in and out while I'm singing making it very difficult to hear myself, it can also become very distorted and crackly . I don't know if that is a reception thing or interference? We have tried various channels and it seems to happen on all of them.

All I want in my ears is my own vocal, I don't need a mix of the band or anything so it's pretty simple. The venues we play at tend to usually have capacities of 150-400 people.

So yeah, can anyone guide me and give me any help on what is the absolute best way to set these up for what I need?

How to make a live band sound like they're from the 80s ?,"Hey,

I will be mixing a live rock band (drm, b, g, keys, v) for several shows as part of theater/comedy/musical type of production. They will play cover versions of different songs from the 80s.

I know that they're pro enough to make their instruments sound accordingly at the source, and I will of course meet with the band and the production in a couple of weeks as well to learn what they want/expect from me as well. But I'm very curious for your input. 

**What would you do to make them sound like they're from that era?** 

(Or maybe like a respectful cartoonlike tribute version of a band from that era ;)) 

What kind of effects would you use? What kind of ""modern mixing"" stuff would you deliberately ignore? I'm curious about any thought and ideas. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be sure: I doubt they want a scientifically accurate reproduction of an 80s show, so no need to suggest any expensive vintage gear, mixing boards or PA systems :)

If you have specific microphone or FX unit suggestions, I'm open however.

&amp;#x200B;

(I will probably be using an M32 to mix the show, could also be a Pro1/6 maybe)

X AIR 16 Disconnects,"I purchased an X Air 16 a year ago because I didn't like the board I was always provided for the only (yearly) gig I run sound for. I did not realize at the time that it was sold to me used by B&amp;H, the open box indication was not obvious. I had nothing but problems with it this weekend. It was on firmware 1.16 (now on 1.17 which appears to be the latest) connected wirelessly in AP mode to an older IPAD 2. At my outdoor gig, it completely stopped working. It seems that it was a network issue but even with the ipad touching the device, the connection couldn't be made. The wireless network was intermittently either visually working with no connection to the mixer, visually available with choosing to connect coming back with a connection error or not even showing up as an available wifi network. At my day job I am an IT manager with a network engineering background and this was no wifi interferance issue. I was out on an island with the device a couple of inches away and the strongest wifi signal I could see was 1-2 bars from the hotel who'se pool I was at.  I am not sure if I have a defective device (someone else returned it after all) or if i kept running into a bug in the software. 

When I was disconnected, it would usually stay disconnected until rebooting the board. I also tried connecting via my phone with no improvement. 

I realized afterwards, based on some forum posts, I should be bringing my own PC as well as wifi router for the IPAD access but I am looking for recommendations going forward. I planned on using the device this upcoming weekend for the second half of the festival and I need to figure out if I should be looking at a warranty return (if possible) or if I need to make changes elsewhere.

Looking to build an A/B/Y multi guitar amp rig using stereo effects pedals for live performances and recording. But am concerned about ground hum. Anyone have suggestions for gizmos that can split a guitar signal without causing phase or hum problems? (+ questions re: micing this multi-amp rig live),"[**LONG POST**]

Sorry if this is a bit too guitar-based of a question to be asked here, but it does concern my hopes to set up a working multi-amp rig for live performance, without causing horrible sounding hum that would annoy an audience. And as much as I love /r/guitar, I feel like all of you brilliant folks here might have more understanding of the technical end of this issue.

I've noticed that various players with really big guitar sounds (like Adam Jones of Tool) have multi-amp setups. Even guys like Zakk Wylde use a chorus pedal with multiple amps to thicken their sound.

At the moment I have a BOSS DD-6 delay with stereo outs and I'm looking to add a BOSS Chorus pedal and BOSS Reverb pedal with stereo outs as well.

**What I'd like to go for is an A/B/Y setup, so I have the option of running two amps simultaneously during live performance.** I actually would even be interested in running three amps simultaneously if possible. (Though this isn't absolutely necessary. If a three-way splitter is insanely expensive compared to a two-way A/B/Y one, I'm fine with sticking to the two-way one. Hauling two amps to a show would probably be enough work as it is.)

---

I've read how on albums like Siamese Dream, multi-tracking/layering guitar parts was a huge part of getting that monstrous tone, which got me thinking that if I rigged up two (or three) amps to use all at once while playing live or while recording, I might be able to sort of approximate that effect.

Adam Jones of Tool uses three amps, with each one focused on handling a different chunk of the frequency range, or configured to create a different tonality:

&gt;So I’ve always played with two or three amps: one for high end, one that’s good with midrange and one that kicks in with the low; or I use one that’s got that good solid-state Metallica crunch and one that’s got that warm Marshall tube sound.

https://www.guitarworld.com/gw-archive/dear-guitar-hero-adam-jones-tool-talks-tone-gear-videos-bands-anonymity-time-between-albums-and-more

Of course in my case, what I'm going for won't be anywhere near the Corgan-esque wall of sound derived from stacking 20 or 30 guitar tracks all at once. But having two amps going at once is still a 100% increase in guitar.

It might also make recording multiple guitar tracks easier, and give me an interesting way to get tonal variety from recording the same guitar parts. I could have two amps going at once, have them both miced up, but have them configured differently so that while I'm playing one guitar part, two different guitar tones would be generated and recorded. And this variation in tone could result from different amp settings, or simply by virtue of using say, a solid state amp alongside a tube amp.

***Question re: splitter box and hum***

I have done some research and it seems that a splitter that eliminates ground hum is vital.

https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Tone_Stacking_With_Two_Amps

https://www.seymourduncan.com/blog/the-tone-garage/multi-amp-rigs-101

But I don't know anything about this kind of gadgets, i.e. what brands make them, what price range they usually fall in, what features to look for, who makes decent ones that aren't crazy expensive, etc. I've never tried to rig up anything this complex.

**Are there any A/B/Y splitter boxes that are of decent/solid quality that effectively eliminate hum issues, without being ultra-expensive? It would be cool to run three amps at once, but if such a box is prohibitively expensive, two amps is fine.**

---

***Question RE: Micing These Amps during live shows and recording***

Also, I was wondering if you guys might have some input on ways to mic these two amps during live shows, and at home.

In my Adam Jones research, I found this information from one of Tool's engineers saying he would use two mics on each of Jones' amps:

&gt;Adam mainly runs three amps: He has a Marshall that he loves, a Diezel and then he was using a Mesa Boogie at one point. I brought in a Bogner Uberschall head and a Rivera Knucklehead Reverb, and several other things. Then we just experimented with combinations of heads and cabinets until it worked for the song. Most of the 4×12s were Mesa Boogie cabinets, which are superior for their low end, except for the Marshall head, which went through a Marshall cabinet, and the Rivera went through a Rivera cabinet. I usually used stock miking. For me, that's a Shure SM57 and a Sennheiser 421 on every cabinet. The third mic could be anything that I felt the sound needed more of.

https://www.guitarfxdepot.com/rigs/adam-jones-tool-guitar-rig/

**Do you guys similarly recommend a combo mic setup of an SM57 and a Sennheiser 421?** 

At the moment I just have one SM57 and three SM58s, but at some point I might be open to getting other mics.

**What does the 421 do that is different from the SM57? Would it make a difference in my sound while playing live? Or just be too much unnecessary work for the sound guy?**

***Question re: capturing three discrete guitar tracks from three amps simultaneously, in one take***

(This question might be too focused on recording to be included here, so feel free to skip it. I just thought I should include it anyways, since it is the last element I'd need to cover.)

I have a very basic Behringer Xenyx 1204 4 channel mixer with a separate UCA-200 RCA-to-USB interface that goes into my computer. 

**I'd be interested in being able to capture separate tracks simultaneously by individually micing different guitar amps while I play a single take, and running these mic cables into separate channels on a mixer.** 

This interview about Adam Jone's recording technique explains what I mean:

&gt;The signal chain for tracking guitar was a bit complex. “Adam would play into whatever pedals he needed,” Barresi says. “That signal then went into a Systematic Systems Splitter. Then it would go to between three and five heads. The signal from the heads went to their own individual cabinets. Each cabinet had two or three microphones on it. Then all the microphones came back to the console, and they were blended down as separated for each amp. The Diezel amp went to its own track. The Marshall amp went to its own track. The third track was a blend of the Bogner and the Rivera, or whatever I liked for the song. And that would be one take — three tracks of guitar.”

https://www.guitarfxdepot.com/rigs/adam-jones-tool-guitar-rig/

In my case, the problem is that when I run two or three or four mics into my mixer, then out into the separate RCA/USB interface, and into Audacity on my computer, that everything will just get mixed down into one single track.

**Is there any way to have a mixer simultaneously record to multiple discrete tracks on a computer program?** 

Is the issue that my mixer doesn't have a USB output built-in? Would I be able to lay down multiple discrete tracks all at once with a different mixer?

(Again, no worries if people don't want to answer this last question. The other two more directly connect to livesound, whereas this is tied more to recording).

I work for a church as the tech director and I am trying earnestly to find a solution to a seemingly stupid simple problem. 

For the life of me I cannot figure out how to create a Bus that, as an output ,can follow post-fader with effects, but I can  mute a certain channel.

&amp;#x200B;

Before and after the service we run a Spotify playlist into the board and out the mains, it is muted during the service. Our worship is contemporary so running at about 98db, when the service ends and we turn the Spotify playlist on, it runs around 60-70db in the sanctuary. 

Here is where it is getting complicated... We have a main out running to speakers under a patio area outside with a screen so people can watch the service if they are out there. The problem is that because the outside speakers are being fed from the mains, either Spotify is too quiet to be heard when people are talking out there, or if we turn up the amp for those speakers, then the band is blaring loud when they play. I hope that makes sense...

What I am trying to figure out how to do is have an aux output from the board that follows the sound mixer's moves during the service while mixing the band and also includes the internal board effects we are adding on, but allows me to  mute the Spotify channel. That way I can take our main output into another small board, and bring Spotify in as a second channel to create a separate mix for just outside.

Suggestions for contemporary flute trio miking?,"Hi everyone, hope this is okay to post here!

Since its being filmed the miking will ideally have to be as discrete as possible, not to block the view of the performers, and I'm not quite sure how to approach this. The ""stereo microphones"" in the back is the only thing I've decided so far, going to use a Zoom H6 for that and run the rest of the microphones back to it.

I cannot find any useful tutorials for the iPad version and assigning  samples to certain ranges on the keyboard or even splitting two different presets on the same keyboard for that matter. I tried KASPAR because in the manual it stated it could do sampling (however somethingsomething LFOs stuff) and it can't sample nor can I seem to get the sampler in garageband to send stuff to KASPAR so I can play it through there. 

My only next thought is to partition a HDD and get whatever Mac OS to run mainstage. Are there any cheaper/more intuitive options at this point? Thanks. ",t2_jn85j,1,1

Ev force i 215 cab and rack questions.,"So i picked up a used rack and cab setup a few days ago, i the rack consists of a stanon rm-404 mixer, bbe 482i sonic maximizer, samson s curve eq, samson 2/3 way crossover, and 2 samson sx2400 power amps, 2 jbl 18"" jrx subs, and 2 ev force i 215 cabs.  I currently have it setup in a small living room, and i feel the room is way to small to get an accurate feel for how everything should sound, the low end is tight and punchy, the highs are really crisp, but alot of my midrange is muddy and gets lost in the mix.  So, heres where my questions come in,  would being in a larger room and really opening up the cabs provide any more mid range clarity? Is there any signal processing i can use to help this end of the setup?  Im assuming the ultimate solution is to buy better cabinets, but when im financially viable to do so, what speakers/price range would offer a noticable improvement? Would it be worth it to buy new drivers and maybe a different crossover for my existing cabinents?  Also, im getting a slight loss in signal on one channel between my crossover and power amp, is this common when a unit is on the road to failure?  I got the setup for 1000 with a drumset some guitars and a xylophone, i know im not looking at top end equipment and im not expecting to achieve that with the current setup, but if anyone has some advice/direction on how to clean up my midrange clarity it would be greatly appreciated",t2_1cjf41e8,2,1

Best IEM Tx practices,"Hey all,

I am trying to track down intermittent dropouts in my IEM system at a venue. We are using 8 PSM900s in the G50 band, summed through Shure's antenna combiner, then sent to a Shure helical antenna. Tx are all 50mW. Antenna is probably 50' from stage at FOH. Room is a gym with brick walls, and the band is against one of these walls. 6ch of ULXD (also G50) in the venue, and 4ch of ULXD in an adjacent venue. All RF being coordinated with WWB6, and using a zone for each venue. 

We used to get a fair amount of dropouts when the antenna and FOH were firing directly at the band and the wall behind them. Dropouts decreased a bit when FOH and the antenna moved to fire about 45deg at the band and wall. Wondering if I am best off moving the antenna adjacent to the stage firing parallel to the wall behind the band (in an attempt to further reduce multipath interference). 

Any ideas or advice appreciated, as well as people's general expectations of how 'dropout free' their IEMs are supposed to be.",t2_6cbc7,4,1
Opinion on mic to use other than a shotgun for indoor interview (story on why no shotgun mic in link),"I had a client reach out to me and ask if I had a shotgun mic/boom pole to rent, unfortunately I don't.

But she did mention they had some shure overhead choir mics (she didn't know the model#) that I think may work. They are filming interviews and are using lapels, but also wanted a shotgun mic for backup. Location is a 20-25' tall, 20'x15' with concrete floor, garage door and drywall. 

What are your thoughts on using a choir mic instead? Any other potential options? I know this is kinda more of an A/V thing, but the only mics they have to rent are more in the live sound realm so I figured I would post here first.

Right now I've got L/R out of my stereo bus and subwoofer out of my mono bus into the processor. I'm summing L/R together into Center.

Is there a better way I can utilize my Blu16, or should I just give up and use the mono bus as Center and send Sub from a different send?

"Concerned about potential for hearing loss as audience member and performer at concerts. Until I'm able to afford a wireless IEM system, is it possible to buy custom ear plugs that block out or quiet the most harmful frequencies/sound levels, while still allowing for adequate listening/monitoring?","[WARNING: LONG POST]

I'm hoping to start a proper band project and start playing bar gigs, but I'm very concerned about the potential for hearing loss.

I attend bar shows on a weekly basis - sometimes twice a week. But the one thing (well, apart from the tendency to get pulled into excessively late nights and too much drinking) that really drives me nuts is the loudness of basically every single concert I attend. 

There's absolutely nothing I can do about this, since every guitarist wants to blast their amps to 11 (which I absolutely understand as a guitarist myself - ego is a hell of a drug). But also because most of these bar spaces are pretty small, and even without the live sound running through the speakers, the sound in that enclosed space is deafening.

**What I'm wondering is if there are custom ear plugs that can be purchased that might allow me to block out the more oppressive sound levels and frequencies to preserve my hearing, yet still allow me to hear enough of what I need to hear.** For enjoyment of concerts, and monitoring myself and my bandmates as a performer playing on stage at these venues later this year.

I have noticed one of the long-term musicians in the scene wearing what appear to be custom-made ear plugs that he has around his neck on a string, that he wears at concerts. I can only presume that they are built in such a way that he can still (almost) fully enjoy the music at shows and hear what he needs to hear, while protecting his hearing.

**Does anyone here have any advice they could give me on such types of ear plugs? I imagine I might need to see an audiologist for these, if they exist. And they will cost in the $100s. But I'm definitely willing to spend, say, $150-$300 on something like this if can potentially preserve my hearing and let me keep playing and listening to music for the rest of my life.**

---

**Questions about custom ear plugs and/or IEMs while performing**

My understanding at the moment is that some sort of wireless IEM system would be the way to go for protecting my ears yet still being able to hear what I need to hear while performing. I do have a pair of Shure SE210s and SE110s, though it looks like it would still cost another $1000 CAD to get the whole wireless monitoring system. Which I can't really afford at the moment.

*Therefore, I'm wondering if the sort of custom ear plugs mentioned above might allow me to protect my hearing while playing live, yet still let enough sound through to adequately monitor things.*

**Though I get that this might not be possible, since IEMs would actually allow sound to come through the earbuds, to let me hear things. Whereas ear plugs would just block out sound.**

Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see if there is some sort of middle ground between doing nothing, and spending $1000+ for a wireless IEM system.

**On that note, since I already do have a couple sets of Shure IEMs, is it at all possible to build some kind of semi-portable WIRED monitoring system that I could use on stage? Maybe involving using a little cheap super basic Behringer-type 1 or 2 channel mixer, that I could have on stage with me, and connect to the IEMs?**

I know the main issue would be with trying to connect my mixer to the 'monitor sends' (?) from the main mixing board at the venue. And of course that might not be practical to run some 150 foot cable from the sound guy's board all the way to the stage for me to use for monitoring.

However:

a) at some local dedicated music venues, they do already seem to have some kind of long cable run (a 'snake'?) linking the stage to the soundboard, where there are some 1/4"" input jacks available for the guitarist to plug their guitars into, that connect to the board. 

b) with these guitar input jacks, there are also long speaker wire runs connecting to some monitor speakers on the stage, that performers use to hear themselves.

*With this kind of setup, would it be theoretically possible to have the 1/4"" inch speaker wire, or maybe a super long 1/4"" audio cable, run from the sound guy's booth, that I could connect into a little cheap mini mixer I have on stage next to me? That I can plug my shure IEMs into?* So I can listen to both myself, and the 'house mix' of all the other instruments in my band, while dialing in my own monitor mix right there on stage?

Also, with this kind of hypothetical setup, could I incorporate some kind of limiter or compressor or noise reducing system, that could protect my ears from any sudden spikes in volume coming from the sound guy's board? Would a guitar noise reducer or compressor pedal work for that? Or would I need something more specialized? 

As bad as loud volumes already are at concerts, I can't imagine anything worse for hearing that a sudden surge in volume or feedback that runs directly through my IEMs into my eardrums. That's a terrifying prospect to consider.

---

There are musician friends I know who are incredibly talented yet quite a bit younger than me, who have already suffered considerable hearing loss. Meanwhile I know there are even some veteran sound guys who have suffered hearing loss significantly, which can't help with their job either...

I was at 3 bar shows in the last week alone, and while I took breaks during the first two, for the last one I toughed it out because I was really into the performers (which is what I've typically done up til now). 

But I regret it already. As soon as I walked outside midway through the last show, my ears felt like they were completely clogged and underwater. And I had mild tinnitus for a good half hour after.

The pain I feel in my ears from the cranked guitars and amps is almost immediate, and I try to sit further back from the stage, though this doesn't do much in small bars. I also try to take regular breaks because I can't stand the veritable onslaught of sound. I'll sometimes feel a bit queasy over how loud things are. Though then I feel bad for leaving the show mid-set, because I don't want the band to think I'm not enjoying the performance.

I apologize for the length of the post, and if I got any of the technical terminology wrong (I'm not a trained sound guy - the most I did was some very basic working of a powered mixed while I was running an open mic/jam night for a couple of years. Though I did learn a lot in that time.)

Thanks for any input you guys and gals might offer.

Playing an automated set with click vs. Stripping back instruments and playing naturally,"I am in a small time local rock/pop band. We are trying to sound more ""produced"" than other bands.

&amp;#x200B;

We've decided against in ear monitoring and we'll just work with the venue to monitor. So my two ideas are:

A.) Have the drummer wear in ear monitoring to count us in, and the set will be pre-arranged on Ableton, meaning we can have backing tracks and automated effects. i.e. at bar 34, the entire song gets swept into a sea of flanger or at bar 72, a nice synth pad is added to the mix that no one is actually playing, just to add depth.  
B.) We skip the pre-arranged set and just play the best to our ability. 2 keys, 2 guitars, bass, acoustic drums, sampler pad, only 4 person group.

My question with A.) is... are live sound guys cool with having one person not monitored like the rest? And if that's the drummer how does that work? I'm guessing he will miss out on the bass guitar unless he can feel it because that is not going through Ableton, for instance.

I’m very limited with what I have to work with at the moment and I know that’s part of it.

Have a 58 at a lectern and two small powered speakers (anchor) probably 20+ feet away from the podium and a few feet forward from them. I get the 58 sounding pretty good and stable but ideally I would like more headroom. I can only get a few more dB without it getting a little wild. It’s not incredibly loud. I worked on adding a LAV and neither of the two I had on hand could get stable and still sound good enough to use. There is always something wanted to jump out with more gain.

Wireless Beta87A more bleed than wired Beta 87C?,"I was mixing my church's livestream, and a weird thing I noticed is that the wireless mic has more drum/cymbal bleed than the wired mic. Now what makes this weird is a few things:

1. They are both extremely similar capsules. The wireless mic is a Shure ULX2, Beta 87A. So this is a condenser and hypercardioid. The wired mic is a Beta 87C, same idea, but a cardioid microphone.

2. The wireless mic singer is about 5 feet further away from the drums than the main singer on the wired mic. (Wired microphone in the center, wireless on right and left, drums in the back right corner of the stage, and this wireless in question in in the front left of the stage)

There's a pretty decent difference in bleed, and they are under the same exact processing, and at the same level.

"Useable, inexpensive feedback buster for small PA?","Playing a few live acoustic gigs (just vocal and acoustic guitar) and wanted opinions on an affordable-ish box that has a feedback buster in it that doesn't suck ass. Does such a thing exist? Usually playing through small PAs like Bose L1 (I know, I know) or a pair of powered 12"" boxes with a 10"" powered monitor.

Had seen the little dbx goRack some years ago and thought it might do the job if I can find one...but I'd love to know if there are other and/or better options that don't cost a zillion dollars. Hopefully in a smallish, self contained unit (ie. not rackmount). (I realize fully that this well may be asking too much but indulge me with your ideas.)

Which Device to Connect Keyboard &amp; Computer to Studio Monitors,"I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction regarding the appropriate device to connect the speaker output on my computer and the output of my Yamaha S80 keyboard (has L/R, L is also Mono, and a headphone out) to a pair of studio monitors.

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I'd like to be able to run my keyboard through a loop pedal and maintain directional output to the speakers (can a mono out make directional sound?). I'd also like my computer to play out the same speakers so I can have backing tracks that I can jam over.

Two Schools of Thought on Soundchecking Monitors.,"I’m curious for  r/livesound’s opinion on this.

When it’s time to get the band’s monitor mix in order, i like to do it with the mains and subs at a good operating volume. This is generally how i do things and it works well for me. my thought process is that it’s truer to what the experience will be throughout the night and it’s good to start that way.

On the other hand, i’ve worked with engineers that swear by having the mains completely off during this time. 

Heard many different thought process on this as well. 

I’m curious what your methods are, and your rational.

This is assuming a few things. You’re mixing monitors from side stage, with or without an ipad for something like a 7-14 pc. wedding band in a ballroom for 200-600 guests. or a similar situation such as a church environment.

thought i would catch you all in a Sunday morning since, you probably had to do this last night.

Need a New PA on a $1000 Budget,"So first things first, I'm a rank amateur so I appreciate any and all input/advice greatly.  I need a system for a static venue (doesn't need to be easily portable) that's roughly 80x60 feet with 20 foot ceilings.  

Our current setup is a crappy Peavey xm6 mixer and a single speaker of unknown make or origin.  I need to support 4 mics and a keyboard.  The mics are 3x Shure BLX24R's and an SM58.  The system use is live music and speaking.  I would love to have Bluetooth capability but it's not a necessity.  

We usually have an electric guitarist, a bass and a keyboard all on their own amp.  The keyboard is also plugged into the mixer via XLR.

How do I stop feedback when using a loop pedal?,"My setup is:

Shure SM58 mic (for looping) --&gt; Boss RC300 --&gt; Mixer --&gt;PA

Fender P-51 mic (live mic) --&gt; Mixer --&gt; PA

I often start to get feedback very early on, sometimes as soon as the second or third loop. Sometimes I have a MIDI controller plugged into the second input jack on the pedal, which reduces the feedback a tad, but not completely. The PA speakers are facing away from me. A feedback killer on the acoustic guitar also works slightly, but again not enough.

Upgrading some equipment and looking for advice,"I have not invested much into my PA setup for the past 6 years since I got an X32. I don’t do this full time but I enjoy doing sound for bands and friends and I want to upgrade my system so I have more opportunities and flexibility. Here is my current setup:

* Behringer X32 Console
* Behringer XR12 Rackmount Mixer
* Yamaha P5000S Amplifier
* 2x Yamaha S112v 12” Speakers
* 2x Yamaha SM10v 10” speakers
* 16x4 Rapco 100’ Snake

This system has served me well for many years. Those speakers are 20+ years old and they have proven to be incredibly durable workhorses but I know I can do better. Here is what I am looking to get as an upgrade:

* Behringer X32 Rack (to replace the XR12 for small gigs and double as a stage box for the full X32)
* 2x Turbosound IQ12 Mains
* 4x Turbosound IQ10 Monitors

I’m going to do this a piece at a time so my plan is to get a couple IQ10’s and start using them as mains for my weekly open mic gig and eventually get a couple more IQ10’s for monitors and finally the X32 Rack. The X32 Rack will give me more options for smaller gigs (the XR12 only has 4 mic pre’s) and it can act as a stage box for my X32 console eliminating the need for the multicore snake. Then eventually I may add either two more IQ10 or IQ12’s (see below). I can also use Ultranet to connect the speakers which cuts down on cabling and simplifies everything (daisychaining for the win!) I cannot seem to find any tandem Powercon/Cat5 cables so I guess I will have to make my own but that’s not a big deal.

Looking at the specs of the IQ10’s vs the IQ12’s there isn’t all that much difference. I do sound reinforcement mostly for acoustic bands and my current Yamaha speakers have never failed to play loud enough. The IQ10’s play louder and lower than my current 12” speakers. My current speakers are rated down to only 60hz (-10db!) and have a max SPL of 125db while the IQ10’s go to 55hz (-3db) with 129db max SPL. That is a significant difference. Do I even need to bother with the IQ12’s? I occasionally do rock bands and my Yamahas have proven to be fine in those situations as well. Again, the IQ10’s are louder and play lower so I don’t know if the IQ12’s would be worth the extra cost and weight.

* IQ10 Specs: [https://media.music-group.com/media/PLM/data/docs/P0APK/TURBOSOUND\_iQ10%20P0APK\_Product%20Information%20Document.pdf](https://media.music-group.com/media/PLM/data/docs/P0APK/TURBOSOUND_iQ10%20P0APK_Product%20Information%20Document.pdf)

So if I upgrade to powered speakers I will have that Yamaha amp lying around that I won’t need anymore. I want to get some subs eventually and I was looking at active options but then I remembered that I will have that P5000S that could easily power a pair of subs. What is a good passive sub? I could get a pair of Yamaha SW118V’s for about $1000 which is the price of a single Turbosound IQ18B. I don’t do that many shows where I would need subs.

Unhappy with AV so far - are there any other careers in live sound that are more fulfilling and have similar demand?,"I graduated college with a degree in Communications focusing in music production and audio engineering in 2016. Early 2017 I interned at an audio mastering and restoration studio and from the first half of 2017 to the end of June 2018 I stacked boxes in trucks at Amazon 10-12 hours per day (no other job prospects).



I interviewed in early spring with a big AV company who seemed interested and then didn't give me the job because the only work I'd done was studio work and some rigging. 



I started with my current company July 2nd. It was really new and exciting for a couple weeks, then the lead technician quit and left me with the only other tech. He can setup equipment really quick but it can take him 3-4 times as long as I do to scan an order and fill it or receive it. He's an older guy, and doesn't know much about computers of PowerPoint - so I'm stuck dealing with all of that bullshit before presentations. 



Our biggest account had us come to a hotel and run a conference. The sales and banquet staff didn't look at the setup diagrams and moved his tables from where they were supposed to be and he chewed me out for it. He was upset people's YouTube videos wouldn't automatically play... they won't in the most recent version of PowerPoint. I converted the videos I could to mpeg and set them to automatically play, but one was too large and had choppy playback even when I compressed it. That presenter HAD to use presenter view and you can't click play on YouTube videos in presenter view. 



I stayed 2 and 1/2 hours past when I was scheduled to try to come to a solution and all I could do was switch to slideshow mode when she came to that slide. That account wrote my boss a nasty email saying she had given her presentation all over the nation and the YouTube video played automatically when she gave it anywhere else. 



Last week I setup for a group with two presenters - one of them had been a surgeon for 30 years. He was giving a deep presentation on the connection between war, robotics, and surgery. He came up and said, ""Can we go through my presentation? I don't have a computer anymore I just make PowerPoints on my iPad."" They had only paid my company for a tech to be there till start, and it was about 15 minutes till he was supposed to start. The guy had all his text in Comic Sans and had 20 videos on his thumb drive that he didn't embed in the presentation (they were all supposed to be in a slide and start automatically). He said, ""Oh, I thought when I downloaded a video to my thumb drive it would just add a slide on my PowerPoint."" 


I got him situated and then my boss calls and says they messed up an invoice and I need to run a rental across town that the client needed yesterday... the guy asked me to stay and basically baby him through his presentation and I got the hell out of there. 


That brings me to this morning. I setup for a presenter and his sponsor groups at a ritzy club in the more affluent part of the city. They had one lav mic on the order and a cheap mackie mixer patched to their house speakers, including some video accessories to get a laptop to their projector and some 50 inch monitor displays. 



The presenter had mailed the venue a flash drive with his PowerPoint in advance, so I loaded it up and saw he had a video embedded in it but didn't have the actual file on the drive the event staff and his sponsors kept pestering me and asking what I could do and I kept trying to break it to them that he didn't have the file and it wasn't a video available online somewhere. 



The presenter changed his presentation around to accommodate this, but then came more bull shit. The master of ceremonies came up to my 5 minutes before start and complained that the venue's wireless mic wasn't working and said, ""How does this even happen?"" I got it working, then when the main presenter came up with a lav he went from 0-100 speech level within a moments notice and I kept trying to duck him. The master of ceremonies told me no one could hear him and that I needed to push him up... so of course he kept feeding back. I only had a cheap mackie board with 3 band EQ's and couldn't really cut anything to push the system up any louder... so of course he started feeding back. Then he got to a blank slide with his name and logo on it and asked me if there was a problem with his clicker... No, there is not. Have you gone over your presentation? Advance to the next slide. 



The snooty folks who sponsored the event apologized to me for being snotty and throwing so many wrenches at me and asked if I was OK and even said they'd call us again, but someone still emailed my boss a really nasty complaint. 



I don't know how long I want to stay in this at this point... I was excited to start doing some live sound and video, but I'm literally a roadie for presenters who don't know how to use PowerPoint and haven't prepared their presentations. I'm Microsoft PowerPoint Tech Support at this point, and even when I try my best it results in complaints. 



Does AV get anymore fulfilling? A friend of mine is a stagehand for theatre companies and it seemed like a good gig but he works 80 hours a week or so and drive a box truck or semi all over the US. 



I just wanna find a way to work my way up to doing front of house for someone. 



Are there any other immediately accessible careers in AV that aren't as demeaning and are actually more audio and video based instead of Microsoft PowerPoint? 


Any other advice for me? I'm gonna stay here until I find something else - stacking boxes in trucks 10-12 hours a day for a year taught me how good I have it right now. 



Thanks fellas! ",t2_x1deb,3,1
Advice on buying a new set of microphones + my experiences.,"So i work both in livesound and in a studio and i'm currently investing in my first set of microphones.

I borrowed a few small diaphragm condensers and personaly A/B tested them,

but all of my other assumptions are made based on a big bunch of youtube A/B comparisons between mics so

before i buy i would like to hear if you would agree with what i heard.

Please read my descriptions of the mics i'm interested in and just comment do you hear what i hear, or you heard something different from these mics.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Condensers (overhead mics primarily)

So from a friend i got an offer to buy a stereo pair of SE electronics S1A microphones for an amazing price. Less then 100 dollars a pair.

I also borrowed a sennheiser E614, an AKG C430 and an audio technica ATH450.

The ATH is 200 euros each, E614 anc C430 and 100 euros each and the S1A are obviously by far the cheapest.

My personal testing showed that the E614 has the flattest response and the most natural sound. It has a slight midrange bump but i would pick it over the others for capturing the entire kit or an instrument like an acoustic guitar/violin.

The C430 wasn't very natural, there is a weird midrange bump. Didn't like it.

The ATH was a bit more open sounding then the E614. Less midrange, more ""air"", but it costs twice as much and i don't think it's worth the difference.

The S1A have a slight boost above 8k and are flat below 8k. Which to me seemed like they are amazing as overhead mics since i get a great cymbal sound from them. And i can add the midrange and definition from the closemics.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering the price of the used S1A's. My plan was to buy them instead of the other options. I would later add another pair of more midrangy condenders to the mic bag.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Kickdrum mics.

Long story short. I don't like the ""relatively flat"" response of the mics like the AKG D112 and the EV RE-20. I know they are more natural but that's usually not what i'm looking for with kickdrum sounds and they make me EQ a lot.

The beta 52 and the audix D6 for my taste are a one trick pony. They both have an overly agressive curve that can be great for metal, but whenever i want anything a bit more ""rock sound"" and more natural, their boosts and scoops are simply too much and i can't fix that with an EQ.

&amp;#x200B;

The sennheiser E602 II was a winner for me here. It also has a pre EQ curve that boost sub frequencies and the beater sound. But it's more natural and not as agresive. Plus there is no sharp 5K bump like with the beta 52. I can get the 2-3k ""smack"" from it that i can't get from a 52 because it only gives me the ""click"" and makes the kickdrum sound a bit like a black metal trigger.

The newer E902 has a flatter curve that i would like for a bass amp, but not for a kickdrum.

&amp;#x200B;

So i was going to but an E602 II. What do you think about what i heard?

&amp;#x200B;

3. Toms

The MD421 is to expensive and not very functional for live use. I like both the E604 and the E904 from the tests i heard and from my experiences. But, i'm not very certain that the E904 can be called an overall better microphone. It's just different. It cleans up highmids compared to the e604 because it has a more broad hi-mid boost. But it takes away more of the below 100HZ material and makes lower tuned floortoms sound empty.

In short, i don't think the e904 is better, i think it's different. And for toms, it seems to me i would in many cases prefer the 604 to the 904. But i like the metal build of the e904 and sometimes i can use the extra 5k click i get from the 904. (snare and smaller toms).

&amp;#x200B;

I can't make a decision here... need advice. I would buy 3 tom mics.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Guitars.

57

So 57 is a classic, a huge hi-mid boost that adds definition to the guitar and that can sometimes be great. So i will have one in my bag.

Beyer M201TG

The complete contrast to the 57 which i still consider amazing for the guitar is the beyerdynamic M201TG. Much flatter curve, slight mid boost at 2-3k. Rich lowmids.

I love it. I would use it when a want a warmer tone that's not going to be ear piercing and overly defined.

SENN E906

The best balance between the two.

So unlike the beyer which is quiet flat, the 906 has a midrange bump. But at about 3-4k and it's a lot milder then the 57.

So it adds definition to the guitar, but it doesn't cover up the ""around 2k"" midrange by boosting 5-6k a thousand dB like a 57. It seems to me to be the best option when the guitar amp sounds amazing and i don't want to alter it's sound.

&amp;#x200B;

I would now buy the e906 and later a 57 + the beyer. It seems to me i can cover all bases with there 3 very different microphones.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Vocals.

58:

Let's take the 58 as a standard and compare to it.

Sennheiser e835

Seems to be ""on pair"" with a 58. Slightly different curve. Better for some vocals, worse for some other vocals.

Sennheiser E935

Damn amazing, more defined and natural mids then a 58. Worth the 200 euros pricetag. Fantastic overall balance.

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning on buying a e835 ""3 pack"" or some 58's cheap. Both seem good. And buy one e945 for fancy concerts since i wouldn't give it to a punk singer.

Folk Band Woes,"First off, mixing this genre is new to me. I’ve been working with a band that have 2 acoustic guitars, mandolin, dobro, upright bass, and 3 vocalists. They’re used to all crowding around one condenser mic and playing the mic to perform. No pickups. This obviously limits control for individual instruments and is a feedback machine. Last night we tried pickups on the two acoustic guitars an individual vocal mics. They weren’t fans of the setup, they felt it wasn’t like they were performing as one like when they all crowd around the condenser. Of course, they also want it to be loud enough in the monitor so everyone can hear everything personally. I think next time I’ll try to get everyone on pickups and do a couple 57’s in an XY config on one stand so they can still feel like they’re around the mic. Is this a good approach? Any suggestions are welcome!",t2_10w6h8,1,1

X32 Producer: S32 or X32 Rack and SD16,"Hi guys,

I'm a (amateur) sound tech for a live band with 7 musicians. We have a setup with an Behringer X32 Producer, a Behringer SD16 digital snake and a 16 ch analog snake. We're looking into getting rid of the analog snake. Our total input channel usage is about 24 channels. All musicians have their on IEMs with a separate mix. 

I've looked into a few options and narrowed it down to 2 options which are (almost) identical in price (around 700-750 EUR): an S32 snake or an X32 Rack. The S32 is the logical/normal choice for my scenario, but hear me out. 
Every musician in the band has his own IEMs. Currently, they run of our X32 Producer which means they all get a mono mix. With the X32 Rack I could use that as a monitor mixer AND route the additional inputs to the X32 Producer (and route the SD16 inputs into both consoles as well). Effectively having 32 input on stage (16 on the Rack, 16 on the SD-16) and at FoH. This way they could all have stereo mixes and I would free up 7 busses on my FOH console.

From what I've read stereo mixes are a big plus, but I would like to know if I'm missing something or if there might be another reason NOT to go the X32 Rack + X32 Producer + SD16 route. The only downsides I currently see is the initial setup will be a bit harder (routing wise) and possibly having different EQ and dynamics on the IEM mixes (which might not even be a bad thing?). As the X32 Rack can be controlled through the Q-app by the musicians themselves and by me through the full app, control over the IEMs is not an issue. ",t2_129ixh,2,1

Mic'ing A Choir On A Football Field With A 300-Person Marching Band Behind Them,"Hello r/livesound!

Title says it all. I'm struggling to come up with the best way to do this as there are currently two schools of thought on my team and I thought I'd get a third opinion.

This Saturday, my college marching band has one of our choirs joining us on field for out halftime show and we really aren't sure the best way to mic them. They'll be standing in several tight arcs no more than 10 yards across one the front sideline with a third of the band to their left and right and the last third (mostly trumpets and the drumline) behind them. My biggest concern is blocking the sound of the band and the drumline from behind them.

My initial idea was to put two or three small diagraph mics in front of them. This way, we could use their bodies as a shield to absorb as much of the sound as possible from behind them. Downside is that we won't catch as many people in the back. The second idea is to use two booms hanging over them pointed down. But the closest thing my department has to a boom mic is the Shure SM57. Is that directional enough to not pick up sound coming from the band behind? And I guess the third idea a priori is some combination of both.

Any insight on this? This is my first time mic'ing a choir and the challenge of finding something that works in a live setting with a marching band behind them is really throwing me off, so any insight would be appreciated!

Post game update:

&amp;#x200B;

We had our rehearsal Friday with the choir and our biggest issue was feedback. We initially had 4 57s out but cut it down to 2 after the feedback issues. Their final position was a little below chest height pointed ever so slightly upwards. There were no problems when the band was playing quietly, but as soon as they started to step on the gas we were hitting major feedback very quickly. We pinpointed the feedback to (surprise) the drumline and specifically bass 3 was tuned to the same pitch that kept amplifying itself. So we took that bass out of the show and EQ'd out as much of the bass as possible on our mixer.

Overall, everything worked. There were only a couple moments during the show feedback started to creep in, but we kept it all under control. Looking back, I really wish I had a drum shield (will probably make this investment the next time we have a choir) and an equalizer. I've been looking at the Behringer FBQ3102HD Graphic Equalizer anyways so we'll probably add this to our arsenal soon. Thank you all for your help and suggestions!",t2_132ty1,39,1
using the behringer x32 SD16 by itself.... literally.,"I'm a musician, with a lot of experience in analog mixing and no experience with digital mixing. I played a concert Monday and the sound engineer needed help setting up his rig. I was helping him run cables to his SD16 in a rack and he was controlling and mixing everything through his ipad and his macbook. It made me wonder, is this possible all the time, technically you don't even need a console to have live sound, you just need this digital snake and a macbook? does the macbook and ipad app require a license key when you buy an x32 or what? I know this is probably a dumb post to make but the digital sound world is new to me. 

Continuing (assuming my question is correct), is the digital snake pre powered so it doesn't even need amps either? or would it still need amps?

thanks, im going to go question all my intelligence now while i wait for a response. ",t2_qqapn,3,1
Dante Controller on Mac issues,"Hey guys and girls!

So to start, i've never had an issue using Dante Controller on a PC, seems to be plug and play. However, lately when i've tried using my Macbook Pro, it won't show me the Dante network, at all.. I see the network in the Network section of Preferences, but Dante Controller doesn't show the network.

I should note, that when I use Shure WWB6, the receiver network appears instantly, and I have not issues with hard line internet.

Im running a 2018 Macbook Pro 15"" with High Sierra, and the latest version of Dante Controller.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I missing here? It's gotta be so damn simple.

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks in advance!!!

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE:

I've figured it out, and feel stupid as hell... The hub I have works perfectly fine. After checking all the settings within the mac and Dante Network settings, it occurred to me that I didn't check the ""Configure Dante Interfaces"" window. Which showed the ""en5"" port as default and not the ""en7"" (which is the external ethernet hub) as default, whereas my experience on PC is that it automatically allocates that port.

&amp;#x200B;

Used it tonight and it worked really well. I appreciate all the advice in this thread, it ended up helping me snoop out the issue.

Thanks again guys!",t2_xqd31sh,3,1
