is a thunderbolt audio interface worth it for a small home studio right now i record through a crappy audiobox usb from many year ago and feel it s time to upgrade i play a fender strat and have a moog mono synth and elektron s digitone digitakt and analog four this leaf me needing preferably  input a i ll probably route one elektron into the other at a minimum i d also like a bit of room for expansion so let s say max even in a few year i ll need  input even if i need a secondary preamp is thunderbolt worth it or should i save some cash and just go for usb i m looking for an improvement in sound quality better preamps and also a reduction in noise which could be completely my fault and not the audiobox usb s i ve still got a few thing to try and get rid of the noise my biggest pet peeve though is the latency between playback and input so when i want to jam over something i recorded i have to put the mixer in the center and everything ha a huge delay on it which is terrible for my productivity and the volume are low overall hearing wise the direct to daw input is very enticing for me but i still do not know if it is worth the   any help is appreciated,0
what s the difference b/w dithering and truncation it s my basic understanding that dithering is adding low inaudible noise to cut off distortion and that it s the final step to the mastering process while truncation is simply cutting off bit resolution which in turn creates quantization error am i right,0
getting wide auto panning to sound right/auto panning trick tip i ve noticed that a lot of song i really enjoy use a good bit of auto panning dave fridmann seems to really like using it the sound tend to be shaker tambourine or higher pitched dreamy sounding synths i tend to have a hard time making auto panned sound fit in the mix well the element easily start to seem too on top of the mix one dimensional and obnoxious i have tried widening the sound before and after auto panning i ve also tried using reverb after the auto panning but i still am not getting the sound i m looking for in most case do you have any auto panning tip or trick how do you get it to add movement and excitement in your mix without sounding overbearing,0
how do you separate multi track's onto different desk channel sorry if this is the wrong sub or a really stupid question but planning to buy some equipment and set up a home studio not really a studio to get a grip with the really in depth mixing and eq stuff obviously without any live input this will rely on multi track i dont understand how it can go from the main file to being patched onto different desk channel surely the desk still see it a one input a it will just be a signal from a laptop is it software that can separate it up so the desk see it a different input again sorry if it's a very obvious question we are mainly based around live sound and don't really do much software/pre recorded work thanks in advance,0
static hiss coming from laptop when using headphone i have a laptop that i can hear noise from when there should be silence i can deal with it when listening to music or watching video but it's kind of annoying when producing or mixing i have an interface that i can plug in and that solves it but i don't like to carry it around all the time i wa wondering if a usb headphone amp like this   amazon com/fiio portable headphone amplifier dac/dp/b0189evgag/ref mp_s_a_1_16 ie utf8 qid  sr   pi ac_sx236_sy340_fmwebp_ql65 keywords fiio headphone amp would likely solve the issue the noise is not always there but any time i have a video/audio application running it will be there even if it's not in play mode the second i close those program it's gone,0
suggestion for isolating small studio room on a budget hi all opened up my new mixing room here in brooklyn and i'm trying to figure out the cheapest most efficient way to isolate the noise in my room and prevent it from hitting my neighbor i'm in a multi faceted studio building with many tenant and i have  neighbor on either side of me turn out the wall do not have any insulation installed between them only  panel of sheetrock against stud my room is  sf it's small but it's enough for what i do so i don't really have the space to build a room within room setup i've already been lectured about how having more mass will be the best solution but i just don't have that kind of space i'm looking for a solution that will at least dampen my output to the neighbor p s i considered posting to r/acoustics but their community is a lot smaller than this one so i figured i'd give it a shot here,0
confusion about automation in general hey guy i feel like a lot of famous audio engineering say that good automation is going to make the biggest difference between an amateur mix and a professional one i can see why people say this but i'm still not sure what exactly i'm supposed to be automating what am i supposed to be trying to achieve with automation thanks,0
gold star studio chamber isolated ronettes recording i'm a fanatic for that old gold star/phil spector sound and i just heard this for the first time the clap at the beginning and ronnie's opening woah oh s might be the cleanest isolated example of the sound and long decay of the chamber at gold star the tail overlap but it sound like it might be at least a good  second edit i got a rough estimate from one of the long clap and counting/converting the bpm and it's around   second at least on a cell phone speaker   be/zm4wljd6clg,0

question about level clipping while mixing drum tried this in another sub but got no response please let me know if this is more appropriate in another sub firstly it it's worth mentioning i'm using reaper on window  wondering if anyone else ha this issue while mixing specifically with drum first off i make sure i record my level peaking  i take time to make sure my source is the best it can be before it go into the daw when i'm mixing i watch my level and main fader to make sure i'm not peaking above  and yet my drum can't stop clipping the only effect i'm adding on my  track are eq light compression and light reverb i don't hear clipping they sound good but i have to either turn down my main fader like   to avoid seeing the level clip or turn down the individual faders a lot the other problem i have is when i do have a good drum sound when i slowly begin to ease my other instrument in the drum become buried in the mix and it make it feel like all the processing i did is never heard if i do hear the drum i have to keep my instrument down but then that make the mix sound sort of lop sided and weak i also use high pas filter on my guitars/vocals and generally try to remove any unnecessary frequency but i'm still learning at using a fully parametric visual eq effectively appreciate any suggestion or input thanks,0
diy dsp like soundgrid the idea of having a dedicated server to handle my plug in seems really great but soundgrid is a commitment that i m not ready to make i m curious if it s possible to run a rig similar to this where my plug in can be processed on another device that s linked to my host computer via ethernet i m sure it s a long shot but if it s possible i m down for the challenge,0

some question before i start mixing my band's somewhat dense post rock ish ep i'm about to start mixing my new band 's new music and thought i 'd spew some question to hopefully guide me well i've always mixed my band and always thought they turned out pretty decent but could be better any general tip on semi dense music containing section with  reverb/delay laden guitar all double mic 'd an sm57 and a fathead sometimes a more rhythmic part along with a lead sometimes just  or  riffy/arpeggio'd part sometimes two rhythmic part with kind of alternating high note so the rhythm s contain the lead basically tip on parsing thing like that and placing them well and all that more specific question i see often people saying to mix in mono to place everything in the right spot frequency wise that make sense but i feel like multiple guitar part require panning i mean you don 't often cut frequency in one guitar to make room for another do you or do you and either way is mixing in mono to start with a universally agreed upon method or are there downside should i do it with all the non guitar instrument and carve out a spot for all the guitar to live then pan to get the guitar sounding good i've never tried starting in mono we 're using programmed drum with superior drummer i think i've got them sounding pretty natural by sending them all to the same reverb and with superior drummer 's humanizing stuff but any other tip for making unreal drum sound real other than the programming itself i feel like in more emotional le steady and rocking music the kick should be more felt than heard is this a common belief whenever i can hear the click really clearly in post rock music it feel weird am i alone in that any tip for mixing kick if you were to approach mixing a band like explosion in the sky but with vocal what would you do with the vocal to still make them clear while also not detracting too much from the music i've seen band go to both extreme like appleseed cast had an album where the vocal were heavily effected and foxing had an album where the vocal were up front and clear maybe somewhere in between what do you think my band have always suffered from being music for musician and i 'm trying to change that with this one by making it a little more accessible in the mix to me that mean clearer and more up front vocal but i do want the musical subtlety and stuff to come through since that really is our focus i don 't know if this break rule  hopefully not since i asked a lot of specific question but here 's a rough mix of one of our song to give an idea of our style any general thought on what you 'd do different would be great i have plenty of issue with this mix sibilance drum and just a bunch of tweak i 'd make but would love to hear your thought a i think a lot of mixing advice is geared towards making like rock music and i don 't feel like that 's really what we are   bandcamp com/track/gold   bandcamp com/track/gold thanks,0

missing  in my mix i wa comparing a mix of mine to a commercial release by lufs matching the two track and then comparing key frequency band i found that all frequency band were within /  of the commercial release except for the  range which wa much quieter in my mix than in the commercial release are there any very common reason for this to occur my best guess are  the commercial release had somewhat more electronic instrumentation would the overtone of these instrument reach higher than other non electronic instrument  the commercial release wa a lossy format while my mix wa a wav file could the lossy format add information distortion in the  range  are commercial mix often given a big  eq boost on the mix bus  with regard to frequency greater than  am i just generally stupid and deficient,0

how much soundproofing do you actually need for vocal i've been looking at option for soundproofing creating a small booth putting huge blanket all over the place but it all seems a bit overkill for what i actually need it for it's only for vocal i live in a terrace house and the wall are kinda thin so it make me really self conscious about singing loud so it limit my range i've even thought about making a small soundproof box to put over my head a ridiculous a it sound at least it would get the job done and it would probably be cheap to make though i'm sure there would be issue with comb filtering and airflow i bet so how much soundproofing do you even need for a voice to stop it travelling through the wall,0
possibly the dumbest question ever posted here but how do you get a reference track okay so before you laugh to hard all of the music i have is either streaming or from itunes streaming obviously come across in low quality and i cant set it in my project purchase from itunes do not give you  wave file which honestly i do not know if that is necessary or not i could pull a song off youtube but again low quality so where do i get reference track and what quality / file format is necessary for it to be a good reference,0
question about phase i understand the importance of making sure mics are in phase during both recording and mixing but when working itb is there any reason you can't just zoom in on the waveform and line up peak with peaks/troughs with trough visually i see a lot of dude using plugins like sound radix auto align for lining up polarity but it seems like an unnecessary gadget when you can just get different source in phase by referencing sharp transient across several track i e a rimshot on the snare i did this on a project recently and really beefed up a snare in a way that simply flipping the polarity couldn't accomplish any input or just general phase discussion much appreciated,0

old firewire equipment to thunderbolt hey all i have an old presonus firestudio project device that output with ieee  i cannot figure out a way to adapt it to usbc thunderbolt or usb3 any idea on adapter if i did find a way to adapt would it likely be buggy or have a loss in quality i might just have to get new equipment but it stink because the old equipment worked great and suited my purpose thanks for any insight,0
wave free mixing course with dave darlington / reference track question just found this sub today and i m glad because i really want to become the best audio producer/mixer guy i possibly can i ve been self producing/mixing a record for  month ive done several record in the past ten year but this is the most seriously i ve ever taken it i am of course also the artist and the writer and blah blah we are in the age of many hat wondering if anyone ha watched this wave series i ve found it extremely useful not always gonna have all the plugins mentioned but just watching pro go at it and talk about their process and why they make their choice is really cool i m not done watching them really but one question that really stand out to me is this when using a reference track wouldn t that track already be mastered how is it helpful to reference a fully mastered track with a track that s in the mix phase like it feel like using a mainstream released track for reference when mastering make sense but how are we supposed to get hold of the mix,0
power adapter question for audio interface i just bought an old used scarlett  and it didn t include the power adapter i plugged in a  adapter rated for  and all i saw in the mixcontrol software wa a full meter of static on every analog channel it s asking for   so i assume that the static wa a result of under powering the device my local best buy sell an ac dc adapter variable voltage up to  and rated for   will this power adapter work for my interface i assume that even though it s rated for   the interface will only draw a much current a it need is there a flaw in my logic here also do you think i m correct in my theory that the static on every channel is due to under powering the interface the seller said that it wa fully functional and he had a number of good review thanks update   power supply worked great thankfully it look like under powering via current didn't do any damage i ended up grabbing the variable voltage power supply just for the sake of having a spare around and am planning to order one specifically for the ,0

audio interface routing software is there a universal type of software that make it easy to route thing to and from the ins/outs of an interface i have a behringer interface umc204 that work fine but it doesn t seem to have any support for software like i see people using with focusrite and other brand i m considering getting a bigger interface but i want to get one that is able to configure input and out put the way i want is this just a cost saving thing for behringer and other brand have always had it do i even need it using reaper if that help,0
how do you personally use track sends in a daw are the typical dual send knob per track in daw an obsolete artifact from analog day or am i missing out by not using them i don't use them when i want reverb on a track i add it to that track and tailor it for that track same with any other audio effect i get how they are essential on analog when i have only limited hardware but a software effect can be multiplied almost indefinitely so we don't need to share one effect configuration between multiple track so is the way they are incorporated into daw vestigial or is there still importance behind shared effect over individual is there a way i could be effectually using the sends can having the same effect on multiple track somehow pull a song together in some way or is it simply just for the convenience of well i always set my whatever effect the same no matter what so might a well just do it once edit whoa glad i asked i'm learning a lot thanks for the info,0

mixing drum for beginner hi iam new into the world of mixing i wa asking myself is it better to put a compressor on the drum master track or compress each individual part like kick tom snare etc iam having a hard time to get my mix sound fuller my mix sound dry without no life just so you know i play death/black metal and iam using reaper daw with bias fx and superior drummer  for the eq's and stuff iam using only the free plugins that comme with reaper if you could recommend me mixing plugins that would help me i will be more than willing to pay for them thank you,0

loud but not crushing transient hey everyone been producing electronic music for  year now ive read a lot on trying to get a loud master ive picked up a few thing such a a loud master depends on a really good mixdown etc while all this is good i still am not able to get the loudness i would like i listen to some of these guy track and am blown away at how loud they can push their track without clipping their drum transient and squashing the absolute life out of their track i guess my biggest question is how do i get my master loud but to where the drum are still clear and aren't crushed to death ill post some track below for reference im sorry i know this question ha been answered probably a thousand time i just can't find anything that ha really stuck with me over the year appreciate any reply   com/mvrdauk/break and fall   super tight kick and punchy snare anytime i try and make my drum sound like that then try and get loud on the master it fucking ruin them and drastically alters the sound   com/mvrdauk/frontline  second   com/theofficialtrilla/playcard black ops xl  second,0
frequency to avoid on iphone i ve been referencing a track i made on various device and it sound pretty good everywhere apart from my iphone the kick in particular almost ha a clipping sound when played out of the phone speaker on the ipad it sound fine and also fine on headphone and my monitor just on the phone anyone had this before it s kinda buggin me and i m not sure if it s my mix or the phone not handling a certain frequency to good,0
are behringer product that bad i feel like having behringer product is kind of a taboo in live mixing not sure if it applies to studio work at my school we have a x32 and it work the build quality is bad imo we almost destroyed some input because the connector are bad software isn't that great they did improve it though but it work it doe the audio processing and sends it out now in the end we all want to work with the best stuff available out there problem will always be budget if my school had unlimited money we would be working with grandma's and stuff but they don't so for someone with a tight budget behringer doe a really good job at keeping price low while deliviering decent/good product how are your opinion about this what is the problem with having behringer product,0
cut eq gt compression gt boost eq i've been getting into the technique of cutting the frequency you dont want before you compress and then boost after compression let's say you're working on a snare drum cut eq you high pas around  hz and cut  hz at  db you now throw in your compressor set your attack release etc boost eq now in come your  eq for boosting boost  hz and  hz my question is if your  eq is meant for boosting and the cutting portion wa done by the first eq before compression won't all the cutting be reintroduced since those frequency were left alone in that  eq,0
best engineered song of all time hey guy obviously this question is opinion but i like opinion i'm curious to hear what your favorite mix and mastered song or song of all time are or it could even be instrument vocal synths and how much you like it's mix eq reverb etc for instance my favorite snare sound at the top of my list is in one headlight by the wallflower this should be a pretty amazing response doesn't matter the genre whatever drop your jaw i want to hear about it edit i'm loving these response i listen to pretty much every genre of music and seeing the diverse response just prof that music in itself is an amazing force keep the response coming i'm going to listen to every single recommendation thanks guy,0
i really wish i could re mix and re master metallica's death magnetic album no master no mix the full untouched recording that would be the pinnacle of a mixing project to me i've been a long time metallica fan and they've influenced a lot of my rock side it's why i started playing guitar  year ago that album wa so well written but so poorly mixed and mastered i wish i could get my hand on it i'm drooling just thinking about it,0
how important is your initial balance to your mixing process when do you start referencing to other mix you admire when mixing the initial balance seems to be nearly the most important thing which determines the quality of your final mix it seems to me that eq compression reverb and effect are just tool to make that balance shine even more you want to use those thing to bring out the character of the part and remove clutter is this how you view the balance stage at what point do you check your mix against others while balancing or when you're closer to being done thanks,0

monitoring problem i am mixing using yamaha hs7s the problem i'm having is that i get the mix sounding good in the monitoring environment but when i take the mix to my hi fi it is far too bass heavy i have to work on the mix and then reference on the hi fi only to find that there are still too many bassy undertone i'm mixing a jazz quartet and the problem is the upright bass it wa recorded with both a bridge mic and a di both have  high pas filter on them and are peaking at about  on the faders but it still sound too much through hi fi and even my pc speaker any idea it's a real pain to go through the rigmarole of exporting uploading to soundcloud and playing through my different speaker only to find my monitor aren't giving me an accurate bass reading are my hi fi speaker too bass heavy or something,0
using both my interface card and my on board sound card hey pal i am a noob audio lover who ha recently purchased a pair of presonus eris   along with the newest presonus studiо  interface i have started playing my music through the interface a my main card however i have a standard   microphone that i cannot plug into my interface since the interface only ha combo trs  inch input my question is is it possible to still run the microphone through my on board default sound card and run my monitor through my interface i apologize for my lack of understanding in the field of audio engineering i am just starting i have a lot to learn i am on window,0
should i go down to   when i ve been doing   or  in another thread on here i wa completely surprised to see that the consensus wa that tracking at   wa the norm at the studio i ve been recording at they d never be caught dead tracking at anything below  i often do   and always  bit depth my project eat up space fast and it would be nice to have smaller file size also my computer can handle it better when the project aren t so data heavy can   sound great then i ve been lectured by my producer many time about why  is the best and how like plugins mixing mastering want better data i guess and then you shrink it down for the consumer kind of like shooting in  but releasing a video in hd is there a flaw to my logic there,0

having issue with a producer tl dr our producer's not what i expected and there's tension in the band/studio that may necessitate change two year ago my band started production of our first full length album with a guy who wa just putting his foot in the door with owning his own studio he didn't have the capability to record live drum and didn't have the confidence to record live bass and so programmed both he didn't think our lead guitarist picked hard enough and re did his rhythm part wrong in a few spot on his own rather than work it out with the guy who wrote them he's seen u live a few time and know what we sound like a a band but that sound didn't make it through production well we finally got around to starting on the next album about two month ago and the rest of the band agreed to keep working with the same guy by now he's in a new building ha a good drum room and feel confident enough to work with low end but i'm not sure we're well off most band in our genre program drum we have one hell of a good drummer who's actually played on only one or two track in the past  year he's been in the scene maybe more and ha almost nothing to show for his effort i'm not convinced the rest of the guy see the need to have him on the record and it's clear a day our producer's too saturated in our scene culture push anything on the first day of recording he apparently told our new rhythm guitarist that he's too good to re record so he's probably still not interested in recording u like we're paying him to then come day three a we're working out some song structure i look over his screen and see he's recording at   now i trust my own ear and the relief of peace of mind over any science and wouldn't dare track anything under  and mention this to him he refutes with something about how  take up too much space/processing power or what not nothing close to a realistic excuse to me but i thought we wound up having a civil discussion about it all he came across a calm and collected maybe a little proud or amused but everyone else in the room got a bit alarmed telling me not to pick fight with the producer and i remember being taken out to the balcony for a cig and to cool down or whatever they thought i needed i came out of it thinking if this is how we butt head we're gonna get along great again it wa a civil conversation i don't know what everyone else could have possibly heard to think otherwise but maybe i shouldn't have been so optimistic he's apparently been open with others in the band about how whatever i said pissed him off they're all convinced i don't know where i stand in his eye but with the lack of communication here plus everything that went wrong with the last album i reeallly do not want to continue with him the last time i recorded with other people wa basically just two or three noobs yelling and poking fun at each other until we got a good mix that somehow worked this is making me fucking nervous right now i'm half afraid to give input for my own album maybe it's my anxiety but something about the guys' disposition isn't giving me warm fuzzies about our upcoming session,0

only have enough insulation to fill my walk in closet booth from knee high to roof is this enough for a nice dry deadend recording so basically i have a nice walk in closet i m turning into a booth so i have enough rockwool insulation to fill the closet wall but only from like knee height to the ceiling all around the closet do i have to fill the wall fully floor to ceiling to get nice dry recording or is what i have enough sorry if this doesn t make too much sense,0
drum kit saturation by track whole kit or both yes i know that it depends i'm looking for a rule of thumb how should saturation be approached for multi track percussion yes the kick will likely be saturated but then you go hey saturation sound good on the hi hat too etcetera because saturation make everything sound better and that can't be the proper way to decide to use it or not so if you're saturating many track of a drumkit individually would it not be better to saturate the bus for the entire kit instead or is the thinking that each track will generally need a different amount of compression is stacking by track saturation with global saturation feasible or overkill,0

audio end up sounding quiet and slightly lacking in presence anything i can do so i do gaming video on youtube and something i've been trying to figure out is my audio i've never been great at understanding audio and how to make it sound good now my audio is actually fine technically or rather it's not bad i'm just a bit nitpicky and i'm trying to see if there's any tweak i can make to make it sound better i'm not even really sure how to describe what bug me about my audio the best way i can put it is when i watch a video or stream of someone else their audio sound a though they're right there in the room with me yet when i watch my own video back it sound like i'm watching a video doe that make sense it's not bad but it's just slightly off it also sound a touch quieter than a typical pro yt video which i don't understand my process for recording and processing my audio is a follows i record in ob with the commentary audio on a separate track i use ob filter for noise suppression and noise gate and i also use a compressor filter with the following setting ratio x   threshold db  attack m  release m  i import the audio into audacity and use equalization to boost the bass and treble i use the hard limiter to even out the audio a bit then normalize to  and use noise removal to clean up any extra background noise/ frequency i export the audio a a wav file with whatever the default setting audacity us for that i edit my video in premiere element and when i export them out to a final video it us  aac audio the audio format option are either aac dolby digital or mpeg i record in a small room and while i don't have any kind of noise proof padding i've seen other channel that record in a similar type of room that still sound better than mine is there anything in there that could be tweaked to help me out i really don't know what to tweak or how to tweak it someone suggested i ditch the noise suppressor in ob and i tried that but i don't hear any noticeable difference other than a more noticeable hissing frequency i wa wondering if perhaps the compressor is what's causing my issue but i also like the idea of a compressor a to my understanding it help to keep the audio relatively consistent throughout which is nice because i sometimes get really quiet and really loud at random interval do bigger yters/ streamer not use compressor is that not actually a thing again i realize it's not a big deal like i'm making it sound if there's nothing i can do it is what it is and again my audio isn't exactly bad i just find myself extremely curious about how to improve my quality,0

stereo/mono/phase invert and for mixing mastering for vinyl i am very much a beginner at mixing and mastering but i am working on master for vinyl for want of money not lack of faith in professional engineer and am trying to reduce stereo low end on a mix i think i am doing okay because when i test the mix in mono mode the low end of bass and drum doesn't move at all just seems like some of the high end on synths and shaker etc are spread out a bit more in stereo v mono when i do phase invert on either l or r not much change when i do a mono phase invert on either channel the low end and bass and drum mostly disappears which i'm taking to mean that if you isolate far l or r there's only high end information there which would be good for vinyl because you don't wan't low frequency on the wide end of the stereo field or it will cause skip am i right about this or should you be able to still hear low end in that phase invert mono monitoring thanks in advance for anybody that take time to answer this edit thanks all so much for your advice so helpful also i should clarify to address some other concern that were raised i am in contact with the cutting engineer and i'm at this stage because my first set of master had too much stereo bass information so i'll get feedback on the next pas also yes doing reference lacquer,0
question regarding conflicting guideline in acx submission guideline regarding sound level i'm looking to start recording audiobooks for my novel i'm intending to use the acx platform audible but a couple of their submission guideline have me a little perplexed one guideline read a follows gt each file must measure between  and  rms gt put simply all file must fall within a specific volume range by keeping all file within this range not too loud and not too soft listener won't have to constantly adjust the volume of their playback device but the next guideline read gt each file must have peak value no higher than  gt by leaving this headroom you'll reduce the possibility of distortion which can reduce the quality of the listening experience this headroom is also needed to ensure file are successfully encoded these two seem contradictory to me a the first one seems to say that there can't be any sound higher than  but the second suggests that there can be sound up to  i'm very new to audio recording so perhaps that's why i'm confused but if anybody can point out something i'm missing i would be greatly appreciative thank you,0
the importance of a consistent workflow or presets work too i guess i'm in the mildly agonizing process of mixing my next release and ran into a major facepalm moment today one song ha been irritating me for week because it wa coming off extremely muddy and i had no idea why it's an instrumental tune and i di everything so there's no way it wa room noise or anything i messed with eq on every instrument at least  time and couldn't get it to sit right i gave up and decided to come back later always good advice another song wa coming across way too sterile and didn't have enough punch i had the brilliant realization that i probably needed to adjust the high pas on the reverb i decided to cross reference the reverb's high pas on the other song to try to unify them a bit more i go back to the instrumental track to check on the reverb and never did it that would certainly explain the mud needle to say i now have a preset on both my eq plugin and reverb so that doesn't happen again literally hour of agony because i'm a total idiot and while i wa typing this i went back to inspect some vocal that were misbehaving i went to adjust the deesser and naturally i never set that up either please send help,0
anyone else using auto tune pro or other antares software i ve always been a huge fan of antares software because also being heavily interested in computer i ve always been fascinated by the algorithm that must work behind their plugins especially auto tune i also found a bug one time in one of the minor release of auto tune  and emailed them about it and one of the developer actually called me to talk about it while i helped him reproduce it on his machine so they could fix it in the next release that wa really cool being a programmer and being a teenager at the time knowing that i wa the reason a bug in a piece of software used in thousand of major studio around the world got fixed with the next update haha anyways i ve been using auto tune since i purchased the boxed version of auto tune evo several year ago and i ve purchased every single update since so a soon a auto tune pro came out i bought the update and i ve been using it for several month i really like the new ui design and i think it wa a well needed refresh however when it come to actually working with it i m really disappointed it s buggy a hell first off when they first released version    there wa a bug where the update window would pop up every single time you d open up the plugin telling you that an update wa available to version    even though that wa the version you were running antares quickly pushed out    within a matter of day a release specifically to address this bug but what concern me is exactly how did the developer manage to miss that how do you miss a bug that obvious that occurs every single time the plugin is opened secondly it s super unstable it seems to be better in automatic mode but in graphical mode it randomly crash logic pro quite frequently like every  minute i thought maybe it wa an issue with logic so i tried it in reaper instead and same thing lastly there are just random minor bug throughout for example in graphical mode the adjust vibrato knob literally doe nothing on line object i thought maybe this wa just missing functionality for line object but according to the manual it should sometimes the cursor in graphical mode also randomly jump while you re drawing an object which is really annoying i don t know i feel like antares ha really dropped the ball with this one and i m kind of disappointed especially since i ve been a loyal customer of their s for year it almost seems like auto tune pro wa hyped up by antares at all these producer and audio engineering conference just to be rushed to release long before it had gone through proper testing for bug and stability i think i m going to switch back to   for now until they release the next patch because sonically the two release are supposedly the same but who know when the next patch for auto tune pro will be we ve already been stuck with version    for about half a year when i m sure i can t be the only one that ha noticed these bug thought,0

will i ever understand compression ahh yes my monthly compression post i 'get' the idea of compression but i am struggling so much with how to hear what is reasonable/appropriate/too much when adding compression here's my understanding and please correct me on any or all of this threshold the point where the plug in actually kick in ratio how much of the sound over the threshold is compressed attack length of time before compression kick in release how long compression is held for makeup gain getting the 'lost' volume back from the compression i'm trying to start with understanding the logic house compressor i've picked one to learn studio fet my problem is i can see the needle move and know something is happening but i just can't tell if i've found a sweet spot am i monitoring the whole track while getting the compressor right or picking a particular good point where there might be loud word or soft word and looping it till i get it right i've watched ton of video explanation animation you name it but i just can't get to grip with it i think i need some exercise that will let me practice compression i have a lot of recorded vocal and acoustic guitar so plenty to work with i just need to know what i'm listening for and how to know when i've done it 'right' which i know is subjective also another question i have is do you treat your compression like a mathematical equation i find myself trying to do math with the radio and db's blah blah blah thank you in advance,0
reverse compression this is probably an easy answer but just something i have had a bit of trouble with i mix live recording from a music venue and some acoustic artist have such a huge dynamic range that some of the softer part get lost a the level is set to suit the louder section i don't want to compress the louder section down i just want the level turning up if the audio go below a certain threshold is this a thing,0

mix lacking energy and punch hi everyone i ve been recording and mixing for a few year now and i feel a though i have a grasp on the fundamental i mainly work on rap and r b but do the odd rock record here and there lately i ve been comparing my mix with industry one and the one thing i ve noticed is a considerable difference in loudness energy and punch a couple of thing i do notice on big record these day is that the vocal are loud a hell and in your face the  or synth bass and kick are the second loudest and the snare or clap is tucked neatly right behind the lead vocal couple track i m referencing are no stylist by french montana and kika by tory lanez i ve tried so many technique parallel compression rear bus compression m/s eq saturation soft clipping on drum etc no matter what i do i find i still can t get that sound that i hear in those record the last thing is that i m scared to death of making my track too loud for spotify a it just turn them way down a i ve received some nasty email from client in the past about this if you re interested i can post some of my work i figured this is the best support system i have might a well see what the community ha to say always appreciate you guy,0

what would happen if you subtracted frequency of one sound from another so sidechain compression is used to say make the bass quieter so the kick can come through what would happen if you instead reduced the amplitude of frequency on the bass line by their exact correspondence in the kick drum so subtracting those frequency from the bass line what would happen if you added attack and release on this effect what would happen if you did this without playing the kick drum sample at all what effect would be left on the bass line what would happen if there wa a percentage for the effect the bass line frequency were only reduced    of the corresponding kick drum frequency what if you did it backwards so that the kick drum frequency came through at  but all other frequency came through reduced sorry for all the question rather than an actual post i don't know how to attempt this effect so i have lot to wonder about also a an aside is this how subtractive synthesis work thanks,0

cost of rehearsal studio buildout hey everyone hoping for some direction here i am in the process of buying the business asset of a rehearsal studio building however the building itself will not be around much longer and we need to find a new place to go i have probably  month before the owner of the new building would start swinging a hammer unless i can convince them otherwise in the past week my head ha been spinning doing my own research on the cost of construction for these type of studio and what is truly required it s been all over the map literally from  to  i ve also been told that a new construction on land is financially off the table compared to finding something that already exists and doing a buildout the current studio ha more than  unit most of which are  sf trapezoidal practice room with a couple higher grade area of   sf with light rack and leprecon controller for larger act and hourly rental there s not a single right angle anywhere all area between the hall and unit are double dry walled air in between not insulation two set of regular old door and the ceiling wa hung suspended independently of each unit with tile to capture noise a for the floor it s concrete and there is some travel between unit they compensated by cutting groove into the foundation and placing wedge i m sure that s not the technical term between unit in the area between the double drywall the largest speaker in the building are meyer cq1 s and a lot of  with quite a few isp  watt wedge monitor on stage buttkickers are used pretty frequently by larger act that come in and in my experience do travel between the unit those are in the larger space by the way the smaller  sf space have minimal equipment or the musician will bring their own usually non stack amp foam wall pad are sparsely scattered throughout and all look second hand / salvaged this is by far the best constructed non professional rehearsal space i ve used the way my first space i rented  year ago wa in an abandoned leather building and the other space i had rented out wa an old elementary school both of them basically just lined the wall with carpet and called it a day now if we do lose the building and i m forced to start anew i have a lot of question in order to maximize my investment i m not sure each of the practice room need the cadillac treatment but i don t want my tenant surrounded by rotting carpet either so i m open to opinion on where to shoot for quality wise other than that a what should i be looking for in a building an empty shell an office to retrofit i m assuming single floor how about height b construction labor rate are quite high at this time thanks to the booming economy and the last thing i want is to end up with double cost in twice the timeframe are there any tip here on managing this are there pre fab material i can use to get a better handle on exact costing or would that be astronomical in comparison in a perfect world i would want to be able to accurately cost the  sf practice pod and then get creative with the larger space to accommodate to the crowd that would be willing to pay more daily/monthly c are there specific guru in this industry that cater to these type of building in the past couple week i have gotten a lot of head scratching from financier contractor and architect who can t quite wrap their head around the concept of these space it would be great to find a resource to help me get right to the point d am i completely crazy any sage word of advice from someone who s ever been in a similar situation i really appreciate the help here it would be the achievement of a lifetime to save this space i just now wish i had a few year of construction management under my belt thanks all you re helping someone fulfill a dream here,0

how do i know when a single sound is spectrally correct hi all thank you for your time i have a question that is more philosophical than technical how do i know when a single sound or track is ready or correct frequency spectrum wise is there any standard to satisfy every perception is it just arbitrary or should i just reference it two example i have this footstep on sand sound and i feel i should put an eq on it because it doesn't sound like in the real life i eq it and i feel it is ok now how do i know how much it is ok and ready to be put in a videogame how do i know the high end is sparkly enough for instance i have this track and i reference it to another one in the same genre i tweak it and now it sound very similar and very good to me how can i trust that reference track of success why is it ok why is it spectrum good for everyone thank you,0

the most insane/bizarre source of random noise i've ever come across so and my brother dj quite a complex setup two laptop two controller synced via an ethernet cable audio from both laptop into a tiny little  channel mixer which then go into monitor speaker for a while thing were pretty crappy so we just put up with the random noise from the big monitor wedge we use it's pretty crap but it's fine for rehearsing and when we play live we use the club's pa system so we'd rather spend our money elsewhere yet today i introduced a new laptop to the setup and the noise wa insane really loud really weird it sounded like someone had placed a tiny microphone in the cpu and amplified the volume  time i narrowed it down to everything it wasn't the new cable wasn't the controller/audio interface it wasn't the little mixer the source the new laptop's charger when i unplugged it the noise vanished zero background noise very clean audio it wa slightly quieter when plugging the laptop into a totally different socket on the other side of the room but still there the noise also still happens when the mini mixer had that laptop's channel muted i really don't get it anyone any idea,0

why do guitar amp manufacturer advertise about how great their amps' bass frequency response is it's relatively common for guitar amp to be advertised using phrase like huge monstrous bass and other marketing term regarding the impressiveness of how bass frequency are reproduced by the amp is this a mere marketing gimmick oriented toward guitar player who either don't know or don't care how the amount of bass in their tone might interact negatively with the tone of the band's bassist when guitar amp manufacturer advertise how great the bass response of their amp is are they also necessarily referring to the extent to which their amp will compete with a bass guitar i guess my question is whether an amp being advertised a having huge bass could translate into anything musically useful in the context of a band without necessitating that the bass guitar take up le space if bass simply mean frequency from roughly  hz to  doesn't any advertisement about a guitar amp great bass presence mean that the bass guitar will have to be attenuated to compensate,0
mastering for spotify i've been working on a song for a friend of mine and he want to upload it to spotify via distrokid however reading i've done suggests that spotify limit track to  lufs while the track i'm working on is currently peaking just under there however it is very quiet in comparison to a lot of stuff i've listened to or even my own music on there with the peak being around  on the level my issue is that it's a very dense mix with a punk rock vibe low end rumble taken out all the high end that wasn't audible in the mix shelved off i've done everything i can to make sure everything is audible and i'm happy with how it's sounding but it's just too quiet relative to everything else on the platform the only option i can see is to turn the limiter gain up but that will compromise the mix which i'm happy with what do i do edit thank you to everyone that chimed in it's been a really useful learning experience,0

confused about my fader reading and loudness i am mixing an album using cubase  pro recently i have been getting a lot more into the nut and bolt specically dbfs lufs and metering the track in question ha arrived to me from the studio quite quiet after doing some mixing and balancing i'm getting an integrated lufs of  i noticed how quiet it wa when i had to turn up my speaker to hear the rough bounce of the raw recording i am trying to get each track to peak at  on my fader's meter peak level this is  which is a good target right my my stereo out is peaking at around  yet my integrated lufs is much lower so a few question  should i ever push the faders above  is this an instance where i should  when would i increase the gain in the channel setting instead of pushing the fader what's the difference  doe my mix have a lot of headroom doe this mean that i can simply push the master fader when mastering to achieve a more standard lufs  what do i do with quiet track in this particular song there are brush on the drum which need a bit of a boost currently i'm bringing the other track down to match but this is resulting in a quiet mix overall how do you deal with quiet individual track that are too quiet for the mix thanks,0

home recording analyzing your room's acoustic to get flat v making your room sound good to you plenty of u are home recording enthusiast it's a hobby we enjoy so much that of coming home layering many instrument together on a melody or progression we've been humming all day getting that flow going and experimenting with new sound we want to create our lab hand picking every piece of gear for a specific need and using it to death learning everything we can the big part of research is how we get our room to sound our monitor of course are affected by our room our recording whether they be vocal or some other acoustic instrument are dependent on the acoustic of our room but for most of u that room is a bedroom or an office or some other space we need to be both liveable and aesthetically pleasing lately i've been identifying flutter echo or high frequency build ups in my recording find where the noise is coming from and slapping  rockwool or fiberglass on it i'm sure many have got to this step now i hear hey the more high frequency reflection you eliminate the more the low end mode will shine through you should get some room analysis software and equipment to measure your room mode and rethink placement also  inch is better than  inch that's when i had my moment how far do i want to go am i producer/recording artist if so do i really need a perfect room or do i just need to tame the flavor of my room maybe i should pay other people to mix and master my music who already have the perfect sounding room anyway that's the discussion i wanted to have i think i'm just gonna slowly fix problem i identify in my process and fix them one by one and a far a having the perfect room i'll leave that to the professional,0
how doe stereo width work for context say you have a stereo track and you adjust the pan pot to make a  angle this will bring the stereo track more into the centre of the mix now say you adjust the pan pot so they now make a  angle this ha the effect of widening the stereo field but i don't understand how this work i've researched mid/side processing and understand that mid is the content that is identical in both speaker whereas side is the content that 'differs ' but how doe this difference result in width and how doe something spread wider into the stereo field i hope the question make sense thank you all,0

is this a thing already so i thought of a program that can be made unless it's already a thing where you could build a floor plan and designate a spot where the audio source is coming from and the program would calculate the room thing in the room and the wall then it would apply the effect to make the sound fit the setting e g reverb eq amplify ect say there wa a narrator and you wanted him to sound like he wa sitting next to or moving around you and your both in a church with the program you could build the floor plan of the church and program the path of the voice then the program would calculate the distance of the voice to apply any amplification and if your subject walk around a wall the program would calculate the thickness and material of the wall and change the voice to match what it would accurately sound like is this a thing already and if it's not why not,0
using a single reverb/delay on all part in a mix i've toyed with this idea for a little while but finally gone through with it i set up my latest mixing project so that all of the individual component of the track drum guitar 'body' go through a single reverb and delay auxiliary to try and create a greater sense of cohesion and 'room' in the mix it's hi passed at around  to cut out any low end rumble and the bass doesn't go through it at all so far i'm really pleased with the result but are there any pitfall i should be aware of doe anyone else here do it this way,0

between the line  the real world hello all today's post come to you from a  seat concert hall in upstate ny the hall wa originally constructed for acoustic performance and a such is far more reverberant than we'd like for reinforced music the seating is covered by what some of my system tech buddy jokingly call a dash array that is a 'line array' that's too short to exhibit any meaningful line source behavior at any frequency specifically four box per side which is barely enough to cover the seating area what's more they're all driven off a single dsp channel per side so optimization option are few since this is the type of situation that we are very likely to encounter often in the real world i thought it might be illustrative to show what should be done in this situation v what can be done here   com/lnmdewq we see the house left array response over the seating area with mic position at the onax of each box in the array here is an alternate view   com/uddmc3h of the same data with  oct smoothing thicker trace and the coherence trace visible for position onax a top box back row the subwoofer is muted a lot of working with an analyzer is displaying the data in a format that's comfortable for you to parse and understand i tend to prefer le smoothing and thin trace but when writing or presenting i use more smoothing and thicker trace just to make the trend a little easier to see for people who may not spend all day staring at analyzer edit this comment   reddit  about using trace averaging is very important here i'm not looking for trend i'm looking to see the difference over the space trace averaging would completely hide the issue that is the basis of work in this post it's a video solution to an audio problem i don't want to make the trace look better otherwise i'd use photoshop i want to solve the problem that make them look that way the pink trace onax a is below the level of the others from  on up and much lower above  or so this coupled with the relatively low coherence from being that far back in a reflective room translates to poor intelligibility for the folk in the furthest seat who need it most what are the textbook solution solution  more box this is out at least without a lot of budget and advanced notice it's a permanent install and the rigging is a deadhang so we can't easily bring the array in we'd need to bring in motor and a rigger solution  close up the angle between the top few box besides the same logistical issue can't bring the array down can't pull pin out from a lift with the array hanging we're out of coverage angle the bottom two box are already at maximum splay so by closing up the top we'll be creating a coverage issue at the bottom perhaps this is preferable because front fill could be added but they can't stay on the deck so for most event they won't be added because people are lazy and so we still haven't solved the problem a an added bonus this particular model of box ha particularly course option for splay angle and the next choice is too narrow for this application solution  dsp tweak the gain and hf shelf on the top box except we can't because we're all on one channel here or can we these active box have a pot on the back that set the input level to the internal amp we can tweak that to get some gain back there's also a per box option for hf compensation and we can try our luck with that to see if we can get an hf shelf boost out of it a soon a we talk about level shading array audio people get really nervous the first issue is that once the array is level shaded some box are going to go into limiting before others whether or not this is a problem is heavily dependent on the situation typical shading situation involve bringing the bottom few box down by a few db to reduce the extra hf down front we try to do a much a we can with splay but generally we still will need a few db via gain and this isn't really an issue of limiting because these box in being turned down now have more headroom than those pointing at foh so there's no problem it's when the higher gain box are further back in the house like this example that we need to be more careful by setting the gain higher on the top box than for the rest we have a situation where the top box will hit it limter first and the foh engineer down in the middle of the house won't hear it if this is a high spl situation rap rock edm etc where the pa is taken to it limit every night giggity this is probably something we want to avoid however this is a situation that prioritizes low variance and high intelligibility and the pa is not operated anywhere even close to it limit for the type of event staged in this hall people would be lodging loudness complaint it's lot of old people okay far before the pa hit it maximum output so the dynamic range issue isn't a concern whereas creating a low variance high intelligibility environment for the patron is definitely a priority for the venue's management the other more common and far more baseless objection to array shading is that any gain offset between box break the line bob mccarthy ha written what i consider to be a landmark article   prosoundweb com/channels/study_hall/breaking_the_line/ about this which outline a number of reason why this concern is unfounded but i'll address the most commonly stated objection here that shading down some box reduces the array's headroom of course this is true but in reality the loss is so tiny that it's negligible in all but the most extreme situation we're talking of course about lf because that's where the box have the most overlap and thus the most summation we have a  box array which mean that the lf headroom of the array is  db above that of a single box that is  db  db  db  db which everyone know is  db no here's the same math in linear for for box at unity      get back to log with    db now let's say we turned one box down by  db how much lf coupling do we lose  db is about  in linear you've got these memorized right   is/1tqiicg so we now have  db  db  db  db which in linear is        that come out to   db rather than      or use    to get the db loss in relative term a compared to the no shading situation in a situation that demand low variance a half a db in lf headroom is a small price to pay for reducing front back variance by  db for the same reason i'm not concerned about goosing the top box by a db or two also for the same reason bringing up the gain on the top box or down on the rest if you like isn't going to cause a significant effect at lf where all the box are working together it will however help increasingly above  which is where our problem is with one pot notch whatever that is of gain and the hf coupling compensation onboard dsp filter engaged here's what we get   com/ebkq5qd   com/ebkq5qd if you compare that to the first image   com/lnmdewq you can see that we actually overshot a bit the back seat are leading the rest of the array in the hf by about  db above  khz given those two option i certainly choose the latter the intelligibility in the rear is greatly improved over the original state in addition i'll take an extra db or two in the back simply because of the stage sound down front what we have here is a pa that doe not get louder a you get closer to it and a high degree of confidence that whatever the foh engineer mix will be heard in all the seat which those with touring experience can confirm is a relative rarity in venue of this size even with limited option on the table a small change here and there go a long way a always comment question and alternate approach are welcomed wishing you all a wonderful holiday season,1

yet another comm post hey folk first off i'm a video engineer not an audio engineer so please be gentle and while we're on the subject of comm just want to say how grateful all u vidiots are that the task of comm often fall on your shoulder and what a wonderful job y'all do thank you ok so obligatory salutation out of the way i haz a question and i've done a cursory search of past post and not quite sure i've found what i'm looking for i'd like to experiment a bit with setting up bi directional communication between a party line system like clearcom or rts and a low latency strictly lan voip solution like teamspeak or mumble ha anyone done this can anyone point me in the right direction for wiring solution or written guide the most immediate bottleneck is actually creating a physical patch that doesnt blow anything up i looked on av lifesaver and i'm not sure i saw anything that quite got me from  xlr into trrs and back again with appropriate safeguard though maybe i'm being dense any guidance would be much appreciated,1
can i link two qu  sound desk together i have two qu  sound desk and for an upcoming production it would be nice to have easy access to all of the channel without having to search through layer is there a way to link these two desk together or buy a fader extension or something i don't think plugging something into the dsnake would be possible a i use a dx168 digital expander though,1

why buy expensive stuff recently i wa having a whimsical what would you do with a million dollar conversation with my wife we allowed ourselves several different situation and in one of mine i said i would use the bulk of it to buy equipment and hire staff for a touring company her response wa essentially why would you need  to do that couldn't you do it for way le i explained that even though it seems like a lot that much money go very quickly when starting a new business and building a decent size rig from scratch she wa still skeptical i'm having a hard time coming up with way to explain the scope of a medium to large touring company and rig how would you explain production and equipment cost to a layperson do you feel that high end equipment is inflated in price or worth every penny,1

question when a lot of singer are on stage with multiple voice on part do you have all bgvs turned up equally i know this is a bit of a loaded question so i will try to be a clear a possible we usually have about   singer with mics on stage usually with  or  harmony accompanying the melody at most our total ensemble is large usually   guitarist  keyboardist drummer bassist and percussionist in addition to the vocal team we usually have a different singer lead each song and are trying to determine how to utilize the other singer in the best way when i listen or watch live recording with numerous singer it seems i can only pick out   voice even though more are on stage i wonder if some more professional production mute or turn down mics to keep the mix cleaner thought,1

i think i've blown up my speaker and need some help hey guy hope you're all having a good weekend just want to say that i'm a complete newbie to this kind of stuff so i'm sorry if this may be a little unclear anyway a i mentioned in the title i think i've broken the driver in my pa speaker cab these speaker cab i bought second hand the brand is netsound whoever that are and the model is a bb b15 i also bought the powered mixer from the same bloke he ha used these speaker with this mixer for year and ha never had an issue i've posted a link below of some photo of the gear i'm talking about anyway i wa jamming with the band the other day and both speaker just stopped no bang no smoke just stopped i thought it might have been the amp but the interface it wa plugged into wa still receiving signal so it ha to be the speaker both speaker are the same  ohm with a rated output of  watt the mixer ha a minimum  ohm output and is rated for  watt so it would be impossible to overload these speaker on this amp right right i've tried the same speaker on a different amp and still had no sound come though the speaker checked all cable and no worry there next i opened up the speaker and tested continuity between the input of the speaker and where the wire attach to the  driver that wa all fine too the speaker cone move free and aren't scratchy at all the also don't have any tear or dent in them i'm at a loss i need these thing running asap it wa only running at around  load when they failed any advice would be very much appreciated thank you for taking the time to read this   com/a/cujjmwd   com/a/cujjmwd,1

frustrated with loudness complaint i have been working at this venue every weekend for about  month it s inside a casino with a bar placed in the middle front of the room about two week ago i started receiving noise complaint from the food and beverage manager saying that they were getting complaint from customer the real story is that the bartender were complaining i had a  piece band last night with  wedge and right when the band started the bartender started screaming at me that it wa too loud i nodded my head and walked away i don t want to deal with this shit i want to do my job mixing and making sure it s a good show i don t know what else to do i had the main almost off and just the side fill were doing all the work it s frustrating to be in a position where i am responsible for the bartender to be able to hear when they are stationed basically directly in front of the stage i liked this job at first but now i am having doubt because of these complaint and i don t know how to resolve it,1

question regarding multiple volume control and how to set them i have the xr  which i love although it's taught me that i really need to learn more about sound engineering one particular issue i need to tackle come from a use case i have namely using it a a glorified headphone amp for my live show i intend to take the various iem feed from foh and plug them all into the xr  then each aux out will go to a performer it might seem like an extra step but i believe it's justified foh doesn't have to solve any puzzle of getting a feed to everyone across the stage and people can share monitor mix if there aren't enough auxes happens a lot sadly where i get stuck is how i should set level for these incoming feed there are so many place where the volume is potentially affected  how much foh put in their aux send  how much gain there is on the channel that feed is going into in the xr   the channel fader level in the xr   the aux mix fader level in the xr   the input gain on the wireless iem system's transmitter  the volume control on the receiver that's a lot of step i want to make sure assuming foh sends a strong signal with no clipping that i can retain that strength all the way to the band's iems any advice would be most appreciated,1
best mic for quiet vocalist hey everyone i'm wondering what mics have worked best for a quiet vocalist in a loud band the singer in my band ha a very soft voice with a lot of reverb on it we recently switched her to a iem setup which ha helped a ton with stage feedback issue the issue we are facing now is cymbal bleed into the mic we are mostly playing small club size stage so regardless of the vocal placement it's always relatively close to the drum our tech last night said that the vocal reverb wa hitting the drum super hard and also the drum were bleeding into the iem mix a lot i know some sort of hyper cardioid pickup mic would work best but i'm wondering what experience people have with each one we have used a beta  time to time but have found the output too hot and high a little harsh,1
help with midi hi there i'm planning to use multiple midi controller with mainstage running through my macbook obviously it doe not have enough usb post for all of the device so would something like this work with standard midi keyboard into a mac will it recognise each device separately for use on different patch any help with this would be great thanks,1
iems with orchestra hey all got a show coming up where i'll be doing some iem work for a few performer who are being accompanied by a small orchestra and choir there will be main orchestra mic array probably spaced pair and some outrigger and spot mics buried within the orchestra usually for orchestral mix i will delay spot mics to the main array i'm concerned this technique won't translate to iems because of the positioning of the performer with iems likely somewhere nestled around/in the orchestra/choir and the potential for the performer's voice/instrument to bleed into the spot mics that are close to them these performer also have a tendency to only wear one ear of their iem a well how would you monitor engineer attack this ditch trying to use the orchestral spot mics at all use them but with no delay ditch trying to incorporate the main array,1

router recommendation for xr18 hi everyone i am am music teacher at an elementary school and we put on musical each year a the main sound person i've been slowly improving our sound situation and at the recommendation of some sound tech friend and due to budget i went with the xr18 tonight wa the first show for parent all week it had been working fine though like an idiot i wa just connected directly to the unit without a router and of course like all the post and review say tonight about  minute after opening house and the room filling up connection wa lost even standing right next to it we couldn't get connected not with pc or ipad had to scramble but made thing work we have our second show tomorrow night so tomorrow i get to buy what i need for the show that night can you guy tell me of some appropriate router i can get at my local best buy that will work fine in a cafeteria of  people hopefully not break the bank too much but pta should reimburse me some i'm also an idiot and couldn't get it hard wired but if getting  ft of cat  or cat  will be a good backup plan i will do that a well thank you and i'm sorry and embarrassed for not following advice i've previously read i appreciate anything you can offer,1

looking for advice on a setup for a live perfomance in a not so great environment hey guy i wa tasked with setting up the gear for a live gig my band is going to do the problem is that we're gonna play in the front of one of our friend's house in a little recess in front of the garage door our band ha three vocal one main two backing eletric guitar and key or two guitar the keyboardist play rhythm guitar in a couple of song bass and drum we have three  pa's connect to the mixer two  guitar amp both with stand and one  bass amp even though we will have the wall on the side and back i'm worried that the open sky and also the front will make everything sound thin and small how can i setup this gear so we can have the most presence and compete with the car passing on the street,1
weird freespeak ii beltpack issue i'm currently a2 ing a show right now i have  beltpacks and  freespeak ii base station everything ha been working a it should except i had one beltpack that i could assign role but audio would not pas through the headset no talk no listen i could call the channel and receive call but no audio i changed headset with a known working set and still no audio i went into the menu on a working beltpack and found that the auto detect function wa off changing this to off on the non working beltpack it wa on fixed the issue turning auto detect on my working pack to on and then cycling the power made the belt pack not pas audio ha anyone encountered this i called tech support to ask about it thinking there wa a way to factory reset the beltpack but wa told that it could not be done and that the beltpack receives all of it information from the role but upon looking at the role there is no selection for auto detect,1
how do i practice i've been fortunate in the past to work with a band that had a kick as practice space where i could do a full show setup using all the equipment we'd usually use at show but due to issue we've had to move to a much smaller shared space in this space the band i work with isn't the main band using the place so i'm unable to use our normal setup or board or make any major change to the board or pa it's an older analog board so i don't have the benefit of scene or anything we basically only run vocal through it the old setup allowed me to play around with the board and try thing without the risk of ruining a live show i learn best by actually putting my finger on knob and slider so this is pretty important to me ever since moving to the new studio i feel like my skill have stagnated i'm pretty green but i'm at the point where i can consistently get sound that's non broken can hear everyone no/little feedback etc but i know i can get thing to sound a lot better i also have several live show recorded unfortunately there not a lot i can do with those other than loading them up in a daw and trying to get a good mix out of them that's valuable for playing with thing like eq compression effect etc but not really comparable to a live show what else should i be looking at practice wise i suspect i wa spoiled before with our old setup i really wish i had tried more thing while we were still there,1

speaker recommendation for a jazz venue hey all looking for some recommendation for a pa system for the venue i manage we're a  ft extremely oddly shaped room   com/a/njsbfml our venue exclusively present jazz mostly modern stuff since the room is small enough the acoustic level of the drum really dictate what we throw in the pa which is usually piano and voice and occasionally horn that aren't way too loud our room is sort of treated so there isn't stuff bouncing around all over the place but definitely still a live kind of boomy room our current system is a pair of mackie sa1530z the issue i encounter is how the sound of the room change based on where you're sitting in the middle area of the room up to where the mixer is there's a raised roof that go up about  foot the room is at it's regular height at the stage and behind the mixer which is  foot a you might guess the change in roof size affect the sound and thing sound different on stage v right in front of the stage v all the way behind the mixer additionally the room also get tinier a in like an l shape so you really don't get much of the stage right speaker in the back of the room my first thought is that the mackies are raised at the  foot height of the ceiling so hanging at about   foot and are pointed straight which affect the people at the front of the room sitting sort of underneath the speaker they don't get a much of it a someone sitting in the back a i mentioned the room is treated but the shape of the room is really hard to fight so there's only so much the treatment can do for u so for now i'd like to solve the speaker issue and see if there's any better option available for a  ft room two  speaker are a bit much i think although i can't seem to find anything smaller than that that is also  way so my first question/assumption is changing the way my current mackies are mounted by aiming them a bit more down would that help the distribution of sound my second question is are there any speaker that may be better suited for the job for a second i wa thinking about doing a faux vertical array with  speaker  on each side one pair pointing straight ahead and one pair pointing down more but maybe there's a single pair of speaker that may do the trick without having to work on an array i should mention my budget for this is  hopefully le obviously changing the mounting on my current speaker would be the cheapest option probably not running me any more than  for the part and labor but speaker i've been looking at have been  each hope to hear some good suggestion and thanks in advance,1

mr18 v x32r hi all i've searched through almost all discussion on the mr18 x32r and the closely related xr18 on this sub but i still have some question that hopefully you all can help me out with i am a hobbyist and would be looking to only use this mixer for small ensemble mostly   vocalist on handhelds a well a for my primary interface for recording it seems to me like most of the argument for the x32r are that it is a more effective mixer at adapting to large scale gig and interface well with the other x32 product on the other hand the mr18 is smaller and ha the midas preamps i haven't had the chance to play with either but i'm under the impression that this would give the mr18 a better sound is this true are there any other major factor i should consider effect/app difference the two are at a fairly close price point so i'm just trying to get the most bang for my buck for my use case thanks for any help you can offer,1

help/advice determining if audio equipment is ample for venue hello i am currently organizing a concert event with a semi notable rapper and am trying to gauge if the audio equipment that is being provided by the production company will be enough for the venue first i think it is important to note that the production for the event is being coordinated by the rapper's manager and is being rolled into the overall booking cost of the artist this lead me to believe that they would be motivated to skimp on production cost and supply subpar equipment a it would mean more money for them i have no serious knowledge of audio equipment on this scale so i am enlisting your help to make an educated decision venue detail we are expecting   people for this event the performance will take place inside a   sq ft basement concrete floor and wall the basement open up to a  acre outside area  large window and  double door on the exterior wall will be removed to allow for sight and audibility of the performance to those outside production detail they are valuing at  behringer x32 quantity  behringer s16 quantity  shure ulx d wireless quantity  ev etx  main quantity  ev etx  sub quantity  qsc hpr  dj monitor quantity  speaker stand quantity  mic stand quantity  audio cable kit quantity  audio power cable kit quantity  labor audio engineer  quantity  labor stage hand quantity  question  is a value of  fair for this amount of equipment if not any suggestion for other production option located in sc  will this amount of equipment provide ample sound performance not only inside the basement but to the aprox  people in the outdoor area if not what do i need to ask for to get the performance i am looking for power output is not a problem we have more than enough  the absence of lighting equipment is something that is bothering me if i were to ask for a standard/budget lighting setup for inside the basement how much should i expect the price to increase thanks in advance for any and all advice on this subject it is greatly appreciated,1

tradition concerning turning on orchestra mics for tuning folk working with pits/orchestras regularly is there an established tradition when it come to turning on the mics in the pit specifically do you turn on the mics when they start tuning so you can maintain that's what they're going to sound like throughout the show or do you wait until they're done because that's when the show 'starts' granted if your whole pit is in an iso booth then probably not but for open air pit what is common practice i'm on performance  of  of the nutcracker this season mixing a pit orchestra and these are the kind of question i ponder to entertain myself during the same  hour show i've seen too many time,1

acoustic baffle for misbehaving guitarist hey guy working in small venue a i do guitar volume is always a problem venue i work very closely with is also having all sort of issue with neighbor complaint so i need to be able to mix at a lower level ha anyone used half height plexiglas screen to control this any note on it effectiveness obviously turning the amp down is the first port of call but if the show ha started and the guitarist turn up often i can't even get on stage to turn it down at least having it out of the rest of the mics mean i can control it and not have to ramp the vocal up to compensate when they do additionally is plexiglas even the best material could a sheet of toughened glass coated by rockwool work even better i'm up for a bit of diy if there's a cost saving so what material would be good one to look at any thought or experience much appreciated,1
will budget  subwoofer be overpowered by  top hey guy i am wanting to get some pa speaker for house party and want to be sure that i'm making a good decision i'm interested in buying   mackie thump  speaker   co/d/0c7ym5w and wa considering getting a budget powered subwoofer rockville rbg15s   co/d/0jhs2wg to go along with them to get loud booming bass however i'm concerned that a budget sub like the rockville above will be overpowered by the top and won't really add much bass is this a good combo or would the sub not add much i'm an audio noob so thanks for the advice,1

thought on bose's roommatch array just wrapped our shiny new install   com/gallery/2t9b8hp   com/gallery/2t9b8hp i'm really impressed by this system and i normally hate bose professional pa this lineup seems great though because it's based on physical box design and maximum number of box angle option rather than digital steering mojo and time delay magic those seems to be bose's traditional marketing tool but there's nothing magical about the design or function just flexible design made possible by the number of option for element you can choose we have an odd shaped room with little floor space and we were able to cover the entire room including flying the  sub from front row to back of the balcony with a single array no delay fill and minimal sound directed outside the seating area reflection are much le pronounced sound is clear and full very even coverage thanks to the single hang transition between box is smooth and directional control seems very nicely implemented the system is much louder in the house than the previous and still with le spill onto the stage reducing feedback into choir mics lectern etc,1

problem of short blackout on stage to preface i am an electrician by trade and all i do is work in the sound room at church every other week i did not set up the stage wiring or otherwise but i am able to troubleshoot and know who to ask to get answer if needed the problem during practice everything went smoothly no blip a soon a the congregation came in and the band started the sound and projection cut out for   second and then everything went back to normal no problem until the band started playing again after a short talk this happened about  time today i noticed that it only happens when the band start playing but other guy insist that it happens randomly also i'm not sure if this is true i'm told the power and av are run very independantly so there shouldn't be any interference which is all i could think of i'm sure there are many more intricacy that i am not aware of when it come to av i'm not tasked with fixing the problem but i figured i would ask yall if there were any idea for what could be going wrong thanks in advance,1

anyone know of a multi input mixer that is incredibly simple to use so we have a fairly simple little powered mixer that is in the youth area at our church you would think that this would be something people could handle however every time i use it the input are all out of whack input clipping eq turned all the way down etc is there a mixer with   channel that ha a digital interface with no knob or hidden knob so the setting could be locked also something with auto gain control might be nice for when they crank the computer output to  right now this is accessible to a wide range of parent volunteer and high school student something with a simple volume control would be best,1

podcast monitoring i hope this is the right place for this i have several friend that want to get together on a freeform podcast project and record random crap for two hour or so a a proof of concept we want to try a few of them and see how they are received we don't want to invest thousand into a bunch of high end audio gear that none of u know how to use if we don't have to i would like some suggestion on how to pull this off given the following  i plan on capturing a muti track using adobe audition on my macbook pro with  to  people sitting around just shooting the crap i will route all audio through a thuderbolt usb hub  we are going to start with entry level microphone probably the audio technica at2005usb  one of the biggest issue is this i don't know how to get everyone monitoring the multichannel mix i have done some pretty simple google search but i am having no luck with it at all again i know that the majority of folk in here are pro and will curse this idea a amateur and not worthy of their time i am just hoping that someone can give me some direction and advice to make a low budget audio engagement sound decent while allowing everyone to monitor the multichannel mix down in real time so that we are not all stepping on each other during the conversation /thanks,1

ah qu32 v m32 this ha been asked many time and may spiral into a flame war i'm highly aware we have a newcomer to our how who ha a past in brass and percussion performance but not live mixing the leadership of the how ha asked him to select u a replacement for our mackie onyx   console he's adamant that the qu32 is the best sounding board for under  however our how ha the soundboard in a separate room from main i wish i had power over this decision and we'll be largely reliant on mobile apps and laptop from the audience to do most mixing from my searching the m32 ha fantastic support for win mac linux io android while the qu32 only support apple device the newcomer is an apple user and is ignoring the incumbent including myself who do not have supported device tl dr what i'm curious is if there really is any perceivable audio quality difference of if he is just buying into the marketing,1
