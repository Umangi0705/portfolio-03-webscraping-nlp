Will I EVER understand compression...?,"Ahh yes, my monthly compression post...

I 'get' the idea of compression but I am struggling SO much with how to hear what is reasonable/appropriate/too much when adding compression. Here's my understanding and PLEASE correct me on any or all of this:

Threshold: The point where the plug in actually kicks in.

Ratio: How much of the sound over the threshold is compressed.

Attack: Length of time before Compression kicks in

Release: How long compression is held for

Makeup Gain: Getting the 'lost' volume back from the compression.

I'm trying to start with understanding the Logic house compressors, I've picked one to learn, Studio FET. 

My problem is, I can see the needle move and know something is happening but I just can't tell if I've found a sweet spot. Am I monitoring the WHOLE track while getting the compressor right or picking a particular good point where there might be loud words or soft words and looping it till I get it right? 

I've watched tons of videos, explanations, animations, you name it but I just can't get to grips with it. I think I need some exercises that will let me practice compression. I have a lot of recorded vocals and acoustic guitar, so plenty to work with, I just need to know what I'm listening for and how to know when I've done it 'right'...which I know is subjective. 

Also another question I have is, do you treat your compression like a mathematical equation? I find myself trying to do maths with the radio and db's blah blah blah...

"How do I know when a single sound is spectrally ""correct""?","Hi all! Thank you for your time!

I have a question that is more ""philosophical"" than technical.

How do I know when a single sound (or track) is ""ready"" or ""correct"" frequency-spectrum-wise? 
Is there any ""standard"" to satisfy every perception?
Is it just arbitrary? Or should I just reference it?

Two examples:

- I have this footstep on sand sound and I feel I should put an EQ on it because it doesn't sound like in the real life. I EQ it and I feel it is ok now. How do I know how much it is OK and ready to be put in a videogame? How do I know the high end is sparkly enough, for instance?

- I have this track and I reference it to another one in the same genre. I tweak it and now it sound very similar and very good to me. How can I trust that reference track of success? Why is it ok? Why is its spectrum good for everyone?

The most insane/bizarre source of random noise I've ever come across....,"&amp;#x200B;

So and my brother DJ, quite a complex setup - two laptops, two controllers, synced via an Ethernet cable, audio from both laptops into a tiny little 2-channel mixer, which then goes into monitor speakers.

For a while things were pretty crappy, so we just put up with the random noise from the big monitor wedge we use. It's pretty crap, but it's fine for rehearsing and when we play live we use the club's PA system, so we'd rather spend our money elsewhere.

Yet today I introduced a new laptop to the setup, and the noise was insane - really loud, really weird, it sounded like someone had placed a tiny microphone in the CPU and amplified the volume 10000 times.

I narrowed it down to everything - it wasn't the new cables, wasn't the controller/audio interface, it wasn't the little mixer.

The source - the new laptop's charger. When I unplugged it, the noise vanished. Zero background noise, very clean audio

It was slightly quieter when plugging the laptop into a totally different socket on the other side of the room, but still there. The noise ALSO still happens when the mini-mixer had that laptop's channel MUTED! I really don't get it...

Can someone help explain these drivers?,"Backstory, I’m not familiar with audio hardware but have some ee background. I have some old Bluetooth speakers with crappy audio and thought about changing the drivers with a some I got out of a broken monitor. The old speakers were in a sealed enclosure with matching passive radiators.

The drivers I got out of the monitor are rectangular and have some confusing acoustics. The sound clear when you face the drivers, but without much bass. But if you point them down, you can hear more bass, but less clarity. If i try to build a little portable enclosure for them, would they need to be in an unsealed enclosure, use the passive radiators, pointed down, or forward, etc? Just curious if anyone who is a familiar with this type of driver what the acoustic considerations are. Thanks

A) don't have the audio tech to improve microphones around that price range

B) marginal benefit decreases, so there's no point in improving audio quality if most buyers won't notice a difference

Why do guitar amp manufacturers advertise about how great their amps' bass frequency response is?,"It's relatively common for guitar amps to be advertised using phrases like ""huge, monstrous bass"" and other marketing terms regarding the impressiveness of how bass frequencies are reproduced by the amp. 

Is this a mere marketing gimmick oriented toward guitar players who either don't know or don't care how the amount of bass in their tone might interact negatively with the tone of the band's bassist? When guitar amp manufacturers advertise how great the bass response of their amp is, are they also necessarily referring to the extent to which their amp will compete with a bass guitar? 

I guess my question is whether an amp being advertised as having ""huge bass"" could translate into anything musically useful in the context of a band without necessitating that the bass guitar take up less space. If ""bass"" simply means frequencies from roughly 40 Hz to 300Hz, doesn't any advertisement about a guitar amps great bass presence mean that the bass guitar will have to be attenuated to compensate?",t2_9tmid,2,0
Mastering for Spotify?,"I've been working on a song for a friend of mine, and he wants to upload it to Spotify via Distrokid.

  
However, reading I've done suggests that spotify limits tracks to -14 LUFS, while the track I'm working on is currently peaking just under there. However, it is \*very\* quiet in comparison to a lot of stuff I've listened to, or even my own music on there - with the peak being around -5dB on the levels. 

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that it's a very dense mix, with a punk rock vibe. Low end rumble taken out, all the high end that wasn't audible in the mix shelved off. I've done everything I can to make sure everything is audible, and I'm happy with how it's sounding, but it's just too quiet relative to everything else on the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

The only option I can see is to turn the limiter gain up, but that will compromise the mix which I'm happy with.

Which bass trap design should I choose if I am using 111kg/m3 rockwool?,"I'm doing an across-the-board acoustic treatment of my loft. I recently came into 20m2 (65 feet) of 10cm (4 inch) thick rockwool (from a cladding company that didn't need it any more and were selling it off cheap.) I'm sorted for ceiling cloud, reflection points, rear wall... I know what I'm doing with them.

The place I'm struggling to make a decision is with my corner bass trap design - particularly the floor to ceiling corners. I have enough rockwool to stack triangles in every corner - floor to ceiling - and build a frame and cover them with fabric, but this is obviously a lot more effort than just building panels and having the straddle the corner with an air-gap.

Now, the rockwool I have is pretty dense and heavy. I just weighed a 60cm x 120cm x 10cm panel, and it was 8kg. (2 feet x 4 feet x 4 inches = 17.6 pounds). An online calculator tells me that the density is therefore 111kg/m3.

Confused about my fader readings and loudness,"I am mixing an album using Cubase 10 Pro.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently,  I have been getting a lot more into the nuts and bolts, specically DBFS, LUFS, and metering. The track in question has arrived to me from the studio quite quiet. After doing some mixing and balancing, I'm getting an integrated LUFS of -31. I noticed how quiet it was when I had to turn up my speakers to hear the rough bounce of the raw recording.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to get each track to peak at -18 on my fader's meter peak level. This is -18dbfs, which is a good target, right?

My my stereo out is peaking at around -12, yet my integrated LUFS is much lower.

So, a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I ever push the faders above 0? Is this an instance where I should?
2. When would I increase the gain in the channel settings instead of pushing the fader? What's the difference?
3. Does my mix have a lot of headroom? Does this mean that I can simply push the master fader when mastering to achieve a more standard LUFS?
4. What do I do with quiet tracks? in this particular song, there are brushes on the drums which need a bit of a boost. Currently I'm bringing the other tracks down to match, but this is resulting in a quiet mix overall.  How do you deal with quiet individual tracks that are too quiet for the mix?

"Home Recording: Analyzing Your Room's Acoustics to Get Flat vs. Making Your Room Sound ""Good"" To You","Plenty of us are home recording enthusiasts. It's a hobby we enjoy so much, that of coming home, layering many instruments together on a melody or progression we've been humming all day, getting that flow going and experimenting with new sounds. We want to create our lab, hand picking every piece of gear for a specific need and using it to death, learning everything we can.

The big part of research, is **how we get our room to sound**. Our monitors, of course, are affected by our room. Our recordings, whether they be vocals or some other acoustic instrument, are dependent on the acoustics of our room. But for most of us, that room is a bedroom, or an office, or some other space we need to be both liveable and aesthetically pleasing. 

Lately, **I've been identifying flutter echoes or high frequency build ups in my recordings,** find where the noise is coming from and slapping 2"" Rockwool or Fiberglass on it. I'm sure many have got to this step.

building a studio in a rehearsal room,"hello everyone,

budget is low, why we won’t separate control room and studio or build a room in room construction. the idea is basically to record our band on multiple tracks while jamming or rehearsing and for the producers to have a somewhat nice sounding room while being able to record external musicians.

\- kick and snare: -10db,

\- sub bass (sidechained) and mids: -14db,

\- percussions: -16db,

\- pads and synths: -20 to -16db,

\- cymbals and shakers: -24 to -21db

People often compliment my mixing and this works fairly well on deeper/calmer tunes, but when there comes a little more distortion and saturation the mix doesn't work quite right anymore. Do you know any useful tips and techniques?",t2_ma3v2,0,0
Is this a thing already?,"So I thought of a program that can be made (Unless it's already a thing) where you could build a floor plan and designate a spot where the audio source is coming from and the program would calculate the room, things in the room and the walls. Then it would apply the effects to make the sound fit the setting (E.g. reverb, eq, amplify, ect.). 

Say there was a narrator and you wanted him to sound like he was sitting next to or moving around you and your both in a church. With the program you could build the floor plan of the church and program the path of the voice, then the program would calculate the distance of the voice to apply any amplification, and if your subject walks around a wall the program would calculate the thickness and material of the wall and change the voice to match what it would accurately sound like. 


Is this a thing already and if it's not, why not? ",t2_12igvs,73,0
Using a single reverb/delay on all parts in a mix?,"I've toyed with this idea for a little while, but finally gone through with it; I set up my latest mixing project so that all of the individual components of the track (drums, guitar, 'body') go through a single reverb and delay auxiliary, to try and create a greater sense of cohesion and 'room' in the mix. It's hi-passed at around 4000Hz to cut out any low end rumble, and the bass doesn't go through it at all.

So far I'm really pleased with the results, but are there any pitfalls I should be aware of? Does anyone else here do it this way?",t2_d5yav,12,0

Recording keys with Keyscape,"Hi all. So, I'm a piano player that wants to record a few instrumental albums. I have limited working knowledge of DAWs and understanding of mixing/mastering. However, I am learning and know the basics. I was wondering your thoughts on recording MIDI from my keyboard(Yamaha DGX-660)and then using Keyscape pianos for the sounds? I did it for a simple Christmas album, that a friend produced, and he used pianos from some sort of Abbey Road suite and I like the results.

What do you think would be the easiest way to accomplish this? I haven't bought the Keyscape package yet, going to be my Christmas present to myself, so will it be better to get Omnishphere or just use my Protools to record? Does Omnisphere have the option to record the audio as it's played? Thanks for your help and thoughts...

Had a breakthrough FOH mixing a dueling piano show.,"Been running sound for this dueling piano group for about a year now. The last several shows I’ve been feeling kind of bothered by the sound of the vocals. Nothing incredibly significant. The crowd always responded well to the show and to me the sound was acceptable, just not quite where i wanted it to be. 
Specifically I felt that a few of the singers always had an annoying “back of the throat” frequency (as I call it) at times. Been hunting it out during the shows as we don’t really do sound checks longer than a moment to get just the level. 
Tonight i finally got rid of it by simply scooping out a whole lot around 5k and I’m stoked! Exactly what i’ve been looking to get rid of. Vox sound so much smoother and less offensive to the ear.  
Seems like such an obvious simple fix now that I found it.  I’ve definitely just been too conservative about cutting in that range in the past.

I’ve been questioning lately if my ears are just super sensitive to high freq. because I work with other sound techs who don’t seem to be bothered by sibilance/ bitey freq. to the degree I am when they mix. I believe that I AM extra sensitive to it because I even notice it in a lot of professionally recorded/ mastered tracks (to a lesser degree than live music.)

I take good care of my ears. (wear my molds after I get the mix dialed in/take frequent breaks when I’m mixing recordings) 

Anyway this is all just to say I’m excited about my realization and to remind my fellow aspiring engineers to not be afraid to get aggressive when you feel it is needed.

Stadium Concert was such a waste of money. Please help me understand why?,"Hey engineers! Long time reader, first time poster. Still building my knowledge. 

I just saw Bon Jovi play at ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Australia.
I was sitting in the balcony on stage left about 100ft back. The sound was so bad that I ended up leaving before the Encore because it just wasn't worth hanging around and fighting the crowds.
I paid $200 for those tickets (complete robbery that venues can charge now) and I could barely make out that it was even Bon Jovi playing. It just felt like every frequency was clashing with one another and there was no clarity. You literally couldn't understand the vocalist or anything he said to the audience in between songs. It was so bottom heavy. 
It totally ruined the show for me. I really want to know why this happened? Because after I left and went outside to head back to the car park, the sound was so much better OUTSIDE THE DAMN VENUE!!!
Was I in some sort of reverb trap? Was I in between every set of speaker? Should venues be allowed to sell tickets where the sound gets crossed over that much? We all know the dreaded Snare delay (where you hear it 0.3 milliseconds behind you when they play). 
I just want to know how to completely avoid those areas next time I buy tickets for a stadium show.

TLDR: the sound at Bon Jovi was so bad where I was sitting that it ruined the night and I left before the end. Why?? How can I avoid those seats?

Any advice for an up-and-coming engineer who doesn't enjoy the sound of really crispy high end?,"I came into music at a young age playing trombone, and guitar. One thing I always hated from listening to early 2000's music is how squashed and trebley it was. Even when I was younger.

Whenever I do live sound for shows and a DJ sends me the instrumentals, I always EQ out some of that harsh trap Hi-Hat sound.

Should all single driver speakers be equally useful for mix checking?,"Hoping not as much for purchase advice as I am hoping for discussion about what makes a good mix checker single driver speaker. This way this thread could be informative for many people. People with more experience than me (most of you I'm guessing) please chime in. By single driver I mean just a woofer, no tweeter, no crossover. It can be in mono or stereo or surround but the third seems unlikely.

 I haven't found much factual information about the utility of various such speakers, just people saying ""this is good, buy it with my Amazon affiliate link so I get money"".

I've seen the occasional post about this topic on here. Some people say why use a mix cube when you can just buy some of the top rated computer speakers from Amazon (the top 3 are all under $25), and that mix cubes etc are a relic of the past since they are closer to PA systems which aren't one of the primary music playback forms today. Others say these pro audio speakers aren't just shitty speakers, they actually have very good transient response, etc, but then I wonder, how do you know if the mix will sound good on slower responding speakers?

Also is there a consensus on whether the single driver mix check speakers should be used in mono or stereo? There are a variety of systems that are each.

Some popular consumer speakers (mainly computer speakers) are single driver. I think phone speakers and laptops are as well, correct? Also the low end earbuds many people use are single driver. Meaning that most of the public is using shitty single driver devices. Is this the importance of checking with single driver devices?

Similarly there is the Avantone Mix Cube, etc, products designed for professional use. 

In 2018 is there a reason for using a pro audio oriented single driver speaker like the Avantone over a low end consumer oriented speaker as far as mixing? Also when do you decide to use the mix check speaker and what for? Setting levels, reverb, effects, etc or just checking the mix to see if bass, etc dissappear?",t2_2qh4yows,1,0
Is Avenged Sevenfold one of the best modern metal bands in terms of sound production?,"Its way too easy to post this thread at the A7X sub and get echoes of yeses so Id post it here and perhaps expand my knowledge more. I tried getting into modern metal bands but the sound production turns me off. The brickwall recording, the overly trigerred and loud kicks, the lack of bass, etc.

And lo and behold, theres A7X. Im not gonna type a long essay explaining their recording process since there are lots of videos where they explained it themselves but to make a long story short, they, as well as their production team, have very innovative recording methods.

They deviate from the usual and come up with new ways that works for them. The drums on their 2  latest albums (TS and HTTK) were both raw yet powerful, deviating from the electronic/triggered drums most bands go for. All their albums has optimal bass levels fitted to their respective sound. Heck,even their debut album (w/c I dislike), was recorded in a "" raw punk style"" of recording even tho the songs were metalcore.

Advice on easy bang-for-my-buck recording at home,"Amateur hobbyist here. I wanted to get back into recording again and update my setup so it's better this go round. A few years ago I used an old-as-heck M-Audio preamp (circa 2004 maybe?), Sony Acid 6, and an MXL 4000 Multi-Pattern FET Studio Condenser mic. 

I had multiple problems that I'd appreciate some help solving: 



1. This setup didnt pick up high quality vocal peaks and sound unless I sang way too loud and that compromised my ability to sing since Im already not much of a singer anyway. If I sang softly it would pick up too much bg static hum.... Whats going on with that? Do I need a better preamp or mic or what? Id love to be able to adjust it to pick up low sounds without that whishing in the background.

2. When i recorded on Acid, it would always put my recording slightly behind the beat. I dont know what causes this, do you? If it's a ram issue,I just upgraded my ram to 16gb. If it's an issue with Sony Acid, whats an easy program I can learn without much training?

Basically I'm looking to fix these problems without spending much more money. Good enough is good enough. But if my preamp, mic, program, or a combination of them is causing the volume problems and lag, how can I fix it cheaply?

Any way to add chapter markers to file during recording,"I hope this is the right place for this question. 

TL;DR -- I want to add chapter markers to a file *while* I am recording it. Solution needs to work in a Windows environment, and I need to be able to create the chapter markers via command line. I don't care what the file format is. I have searched for this extensively on google, but haven't found any solutions, so either what I want is impossible, or I'm using searching for the wrong thing, as it seems unlikely that I'm the first person to want to do this.

Long version with details: 

I'm creating audio recordings of surveys that will be used for research and quality control. We currently use SoX to record because of the command line capabilities, meaning we can use our survey administration software to automatically turn on recording when participants give consent. 

I'd really like to find a way to add chapter markers (or similar embedded data) about where specific survey questions start within the file. This would hopefully allow researchers and quality control staff to quickly find a single question in a large audio file. For this to be practical, I need to be able to pass this information via command line while the recording is being created. I don't think SoX can do this, but perhaps someone here has ideas on whether this can be accomplished with other tools?

I'm not wed to any specific file format. We currently use Mp3, but if there is a solution available for this, I'm already assuming I need to change to a different format. 

The surveys we conduct range in length between 45 minutes and 3 hours, and we conduct thousands of surveys per year, so editing chapter markers in post is out of scope. I have considered breaking the recordings into many single-question files, but this would mean creating hundreds of files per survey administered, so file management could be cumbersome. Additionally, some questions are very short (only a few seconds) and we have had issues with SoX cutting off the final couple seconds of some files. It seems when we create a new file it discards whatever is in the buffer at that time instead of writing it to the file. So far this has been an acceptable level of data loss, as we currently only split each survey into a few tracks (due to our experience with SoX becoming unstable with Mp3 tracks over ~90 minutes in length). However, it would not be acceptable to lose the final seconds of every question we administer because that would often mean losing the answer given by the survey participant. 

Thanks for reading and considering this problem.",t2_dhfk2,0,0

Mixing 7.1 Channels using mutiple stereo mixers,"So I got this thing I want, basically to be able to hear stuff from my computer and game consoles at the same time, for ease of access and doing multiple tasks (like listening to music from pc while gaming on Console.

Recording on 8-track with stereo instruments: conserving tracks,"This seems like a very basic question, but I wasn't able to find a straight answer through search.

Fatness in a mix in the wrong places?,"Hey guys, having a bit of a problem.

Mixing an alt rock track yesterday and got it to where I thought it was great, then did some references. 

In my reference tracks, the drums are nice and crisp, but the bass is fat and full. In my mix, the drums are a little muddy and the bass is crisp but slightly lacking. The multitracks were the best recordings I’ve made in my life so far (IMHO), and I’m happy overall with the progress. But this is irritating me - I feel the drums are 99% there but there’s something missing, like the sustain of snares etc. But when I compress it a little harder (even with a longer attack and release) it just loses that punch. I’m trying to avoid parallel compression for the minute if I can.

Best Mixing Analogy Ever! Mixing is like pizza...,"Mixing is like pizza. All nice and neat like Dominoes...sucks!  Best pizza's in the world are always a little sloppy looking.   
The best MIXING lesson I learned many years ago, was when the producer fell asleep, and me and the artist spent all night finishing the mix. We had it 'perfect'. Then the producer, Randy Muller, woke up about 6am, and said ""let me see what you got"". After he heard it, he turned to us and said ""congratulations, you have an A+ in mixing. Everything is perfectly in it's place"". So we were happy. For a moment. Then he said, ""but I get no feeling from it, nothing is jumping out, there's no grit or dirtiness, and we have to start over!"" Or something like that. So I made a DAT copy of what we had, and thought there was no way we were going to beat our mix. And about 4 hours later, when we thought we had it, I compared it to what we spent all night on, and the new mix KILLED our old one!!! It was so much more exciting.   
So my point is...don't overmix. You can make things a little raw, let some dynamics pop out, and don't be so safe! Perfect in NOT perfect!

Wanting different loudnesses,"In a mastering scenario, how would you handle wanting different loudness for different tracks on the same album? That is, mastering for a normalizing spotify-like platform.

For example, I am working on an album where there's a short intro track that needs to be very dynamic and also kinda quiet compared to the following songs. I've measured it to about -22 LUFS (and I refuse to make it louder), so I'm afraid there's going to be a problem on playback if the rest of the tracks are -14, probably with the intro being normalized way up and throwing off the whole vibe.

How do dual output synths give stereo width?,"Hey guys,  


lately I've been asking a lot of questions, and trying to understand stereo width better. I have been struggling with guitar width and grasping that it is a mono signal so the best you can do is use effects to create a difference between hard panned signals, or you can double track the same part.   


But my question is then for something like a DX7 or any hardware synth, how do the patches on there have stereo width? Like a tine piano sound on my DX7 sounds so nice and full and wide with no perceivable phase cancellation between each side. Specifically what is happening in the sound card of that DX7 that makes the sides different enough to not cancel out when spread wide hard L and hard R? Is it micro discrepancies in pitch? or timing?

How does a Roland JC120's Stereo output work?,"The title says it all.

And wouldn't this cause phase issues? When I ask about simulating that in my DAW doing just that (L = wet, R= Dry hard panned) people say that's a bad move because it causes phasing issues in mono. Is there a time delay on one side built into the JC120?  


On that same vein, how does a classic Rhodes piano, which to my understanding outputs mono, become stereo on so many recordings? Two mics on the amp? Wouldn't there be phase issues then as well?

Speeding up/slowing down tracks by percentages,"Hey folks.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully someone can help me and my soft brain with this query. Essentially, we're shooting a music video tomorrow and the director has requested that I make some slowed down and sped up versions of the song so we can shoot to those. They've asked for a variety of different speeds but I'm having a little difficulty wrapping my head around the percentages. I wanna make sure I get this right and that we aren't in for some nasty surprises in post!

The best way to articulate my query is with an example I suppose. For one of the versions, she would like a render at 51.1% speed. I'm using Logic which has a vari-speed function but you can't just set it at 51.1% of the tempo, you can only subtract or add percentages. I am right in presuming that subtracting 48.9% off the original track would be the same thing as setting it at 51.1%? I'm just very wary of screwing this up so wanted to get a second opinion with the dastardly percentages!

Studio Engineering with a disability?,"Hi, this community seems really helpful so I thought I'd ask here.

I won't go into too much detail, but I have a degenerative disabilty which targets my hands and feet. After ten years of playing piano and making music, I've come to find that my ability to play is starting to worsen due to the wasting it's causing in my hand muscles. It's saddening and has been hard to come to terms with as I'm still only young, but I've decided to shift my focus towards music production and studio engineering, as it'll still enable me to play a role in the music creation process without necessarily being able to play an instrument (of course I have good aural skills and good theory knowledge still).

I've done a bit of assistant engineering work in the studio near me and have been able to watch the lead engineer work and also help out where I can. I seem to be able to manage fine, with the one exception being with mic stands. I don't have very good grip or much fine motor control in my fingers, which makes tightening the different sections of the stand with the screws and things quite difficult. I have a similar issue with mic clips, too. I've had to ask for help with these things. The lead engineer at the studio knows about my condition and is very understanding, but I feel like not everybody will be so understanding

Do any of you guys here know of any devices or tips that might help? It's a really minor thing, but if I can't do something as simple as setting up a mic stand without asking for help, I feel like I'm not going to be received so well by other engineers, as well as clients.

There's also issues that may arise with heavy lifting - amps, bulky instruments etc, which can't really be helped, beyond having the equipment in position beforehand. But the stand thing is most importnat for me at the moment.

Advice on recording vocals in a small room,"I've been thinking about how to go about recording vocals in my bedroom, but I live in a tight space - 9'11"" by 4'10"" (ceiling is 7'9"") which is mostly taken up by my bed/closet/work station. 

From what I've read people recommend to record in the center of the room but my window leaks a lot of noise which picks up on the mic. 

I know people aren't here for turning closets into vocal booths but I'm willing to spend decent money for acoustic treatment.

So should I opt for treating my bedroom - which will probably have to lead to sealing my window or something - or making a closet booth and adding a vocal filter?

"Is there anything ""wrong"" with running a (external) preamp into an (audio interface) preamp?","**Short version:** Most consumer audio interfaces do not have line inputs that bypass a preamp stage. What issues can you expect (if any) if you were to route an external preamp into an audio interface channel with a preamp?

**Long version:** I have an external preamp I like to use (Focusrite ISA One). I've been using it with a Steinberg UR44 which has two line inputs with no preamp stage. Perfect! However, I needed more I/Os than the UR44 offered, so I picked up a Focusrite Scarlett 18i20. The problem is, the Scarlett 18i20 doesn't have any line inputs that bypass the preamps (in fact, it seems most consumer level audio interfaces with lots of IOs do not offer line inputs that bypass a preamp stage). So if I were to use my Isa One, I'd have to connect to one of the Scarlett preamps, thus the mic signal now going through 2 preamp stages.

The interwebs seems split on whether or not this matters, especially with pres like the ones on the Focusrite that are meant to be transparent.

So... is this even something worth worrying about? Is anyone out there sending an external preamp signal through one of their audio interface preamps to get tracked onto your DAW? I've been eyeing a few other external pres, but I don't want to spend money on things that will be negatively affected by my audio interface situation. Or is their something I can connect to the Scarlett's ADAT in/out that doesnt have pres?

"Recording a band and capturing the discussions between takes, etc - parallel to the studio recording setup?","I'm doing a radio documentary about the making of a song and I need to capture a whole session - like 12 hours or something - in a live room at a studio.

\- getting the right mics to pick up what happens in the room, especially as people will be moving around a lot;

\- making sure the mics don't peak, especially given I have to pick up audio loud enough to get discussion from the band AND soft enough not to be overloaded by the band (which is a rock band - drums, bass, etc);

\- placing the mics so they're not in the way of the actual recording session.

How to produce a good quality sound using home recording gear,"Hey everyone, I'm a bedroom artist and worked bit by bit to buy what I believe is the minimum but enough gear to finally express my musical tendencies.

I play indie rock music, and use a Fender Stratocaster as my guitar. But I'm having issues balancing all the layers and sounds that I add. 

For instance, I always find the guitar overshadowing the drums or my singing, or the keyboard riff just completely disappear. I try to change the volume levels but it's not exactly how I wanted to sound. 

I often export my work to .mp3 and pass it around to people to hear, and they don't complain at all about these issues and quite enjoy my songs, but I'm far from being satisfied with the results. 

I didn't do any studies in sound engineering, it is just a passion of mine, so I don't know anything about EQ or master levels etc...

I'm using OBS Studio for creating youtube videos and this program allows me to use plugins on individual audio tracks (e.g. windows audio, mic audio), but not on the master track. By using my plugins i can set every individual track to continiously adjust to a certain loudness value, but not the master track.

Knowing the individual loudness of two or more tracks in lufs, and wanting the resulting master mix to be at -13 lufs, how much loudness should each track have? In essence, **how do i add loudness values** **from individual tracks** to find the overall loudness of a mix?",t2_713ip,4,0

"Snares/claps sound super ""sharp"" and cause ear fatigue/pain even at low levels ?","Hello,  


I recently fell in love with mixing after being intimidated from it for a long time. Feels so great to finally see progress in it. Lately I've been mixing a lot, but my snares and drums often sound super harsh and bright. I have a roommate, so if I want to mix at night, I have to use headphones (Sony MDR-7506s), but even at super low levels, my ears start to hurt (mostly from snares and claps) after 15-20 minutes.   


Are there certain frequencies I need to be cutting? Is it possible that I'm just not controlling my high end at all? Most of my mixing is about clearing up the low end. I don't often see advice about handling the high end of mixes? Am I missing some information.  


In addition, I saw someone say that they think soundcloud destroys their high end, but It think in general, alll of my mixes have sounded better once I upload to soundcloud. This probably (definitely) means I need a lot more practice mixing, but could this also point out that I have way too much high end in my mix?

Amount of people in the studio,"Do you ever set a limit? 
Some sessions it’s like the artists (like one person) brings family friends kids and their producer, and their dealer.

It’s gets so distracting having like 20 people in the control room. Between baby cries, phone conversations, YouTube videos, and the sound of mouth noises from chips being eaten it drives me crazy. 

I could seriously punch someone mid session from it and many times stop because it’s sensory overload. 

Has anyone else gone through this? What do you do? 

- update at 11:16pm 

Made it through the session, aaaand someone broke into the studios office and stole the cash for the 10 hour session. Thank the stars I didn’t give the artist anything. So now it’s their job to find who took that money and get it to us. I’m probably going to cancel tomorrow’s session they booked just because someone was snooping around where they weren’t supposed to and it’s kind of killed the chill vibe from working with them.  I don’t want to work sessions where I’m questioning who may steal something or rob me.

A voice with a bad *recorded* noise reducer,"Let me begin this by saying. My area of expertise is music and this is a video of 15 minutes I'm working on.

Now for some reason when they recorded the video and more importantly, the audio. They set a noise reducer on everything. This created a kinda ""sush-ing"" sound on the voices and I've tried to remove it with parallel compression and with eq. And I wasn't able to. 
What I did to ""solve"" the issue was play with the background noise enough  for it not to be heard but I did wanna see if anyone had had an issue like this before and how you solved it.

*Note* I know masking the sound isn't the best solution but is the best thing I found that worked. I'm writing this as a sort of let me try other things before I say this is the best I can do.

Does distortion inherently increase brightness?,"I'm just trying to figure out if my assumptions and understanding are true on the topic. It seems to me that it's a double whammy:

* Both clipping distortion and harmonic distortion increase higher frequency content because they generate harmonics in various orders.
* A lot of psychoacoustic things come into play: complex waveforms are easier to hear than more sinusoidal ones, higher frequencies (up to a point) are easier to hear and identify direction on, etc.

Would it be best if I took the song down and remastered it, or is this normal?

De-essing while tracking?,"I recently bought an Apollo Twin and am looking forward to having the capability to record while using plugins.

However, I don't know if I should record vocals with a de-esser, or do that processing later.  I would probably use the de-esser before the LA-2A, so those peaks don't effect the LA-2A as much.

Are there remasters that actually made a world of difference compared to their previous release or were they all just ""meh""?

Two part question; Does not having a true ground (electrical outlets) add a lot of noise to mic preamps? /What can I do to reduce preamp noise,"So I am looking at getting the SM7b for gaming/streaming/general voice chat (yes I know it's overkill, but I like to go over the top with things). I currently have a Behinger X18 digital mixer. I was going to get the Cloudlifter CL-1 for the SM7b to add some (hopefully) clean signal. However, I'm afraid I will still have too much noise. When I turn the gain up on my X18 mixer with nothing plugged in, there is a decent amount of [hiss](https://clyp.it/yz0kn0cy?token=6b7ca630a7b2d07e40f9fb299064dfaa). That is with the preamp gain set to +60.

What can I do to get a cleaner signal if I decide to get the SM7b that requires a lot of gain? I wasn't sure if this has anything to do with it, but the house I'm renting is ungrounded. I know the preamps in this aren't the best in the world, but they are supposed to be Midas designed (whatever that means). I do see people recommend the dbx 286s instead of the cloud lifter, but I don't think I want to spend the extra money on that. I can already do gate/compression/everything on the X18 mixer.

Did I just damage my new yamaha monitors?,"Hey guys, I just recently bought a pair of the Yamaha HS7s and was super excited to set them up. At first I originally set them up correctly with the XLR inputs connected to my focusrite interface and everything sounded amazing. But today, I found a spare aux to dual 1/4"" cable and had the dumbest idea to hook up them up along with the XLR inputs so I could also play music on my phone. (I know I know... I should've read the manual that clearly states not to use both inputs at the same time). For some reason I thought they'd be able to handle switching between the inputs automatically. So I plugged both of the inputs in and I noticed that the volume dropped by around half when playing audio through the XLR inputs and also there was a high pitch noise coming from the monitors whenever my phone was connected to the 1/4"" inputs but the volume was normal. This is when I figured something was wrong and read the manual and immediately disconnected the 1/4"" inputs...

Peaking within plugins or in between plugins but no clipping—is this ok?,"So just like the title says, is it ok for plugins to peak as long as everything is turned down at the end of the chain?

I’ll give an example.  Say I have a compressor, I’m pushing it pretty hard and the meter in the plugin is hitting red.  But it’s not clipping.  I’ll usually pull it down to keep it out of the red before continue processing the signal.  Is this necessary?

Sometimes it’s not peaking on the plugin’s meter but I’ll have an eq set up after my compression and the “in” signal on the eq is peaking.  Should I turn down the compressor, or can just turn down my in signal on the eq?  Sometimes it’s fine in the plugin but the track meter is peaking... but I can’t hear any clipping. Should I turn down down the track or tweak my plugins so they don’t push the signal too hard?

Often, even though there’s no peak in the plugin, I’ll have to turn down the plugin so my signal is not peaking the “in” of a plugin after it.  Does this matter or should I be more concerned with actual clipping?  

Assuming there’s no audible clipping, at what stage should I be concerned about being in the red? Can I just slap a limiter after my my cranked compressor or at the end of my effects chain?  Or do I have to be super meticulous and make sure the signal isn’t peaking at each stage of processing, even though there’s no clipping? ",t2_xowqr,8,0

Will hearing loss afect my mixing?,I have hearing loss and I've been mixing for quite some time. I try to treat my ears good.

how can i fairly compare volume difference comparisons in field recording?,"example, i want to reference how loud a gun is from a far distance, so i play a ringtone from a phone a few feet from the mic while the shot goes off. the phone gives a reference of how strong the gain is on the mic. i just want a way to show what something sounds like, without the viewer not knowing how loud to have their listening volume.  basically, if the reference sound is something everyone knows, they can reasonably compare the target sound. i hope i make sense. my question is what kinds of sounds would be good to use as the phone in this example?",t2_12dy9x,1,0
No New Gear November is giving me BAD G.A.S.,"How do you all deal with G.A.S.?  I've got a Lindell Audio 17XS MkII compressor that I love to use, but for the sake of doing a quick bass track for a Riders on the Storm cover, I skipped the comp for the recording and just mic'd the amp for a straight signal.  In Studio One I went ahead and smashed it with the Waves DBX Compressor plugin and it sounds fat.  Like really good.  This unfortunately made me question whether I should sell my comp and by a few mics and a pedal I've been eyeing (SM57, E906, Sennheiser E904, and the Belle Epoch Delay Pedal).

What are your techniques for identifying empty space in a mix?,"Everybody always talks about identifying regions that're too full, but what about regions that are too empty? If a mix is a little thin and I can't immediately figure out what needs to be added I'll usually solo a pretty thin band (high Q) on the master and sweep through trying to find space (both in mono and stereo). I find though that this method can confuse you since one band might be louder than the others and so when soloing you kind of loose sense of dymanics. I'm wondering what are some other methods for identifying space in a mix?",t2_gfkig,6,0
Completely handicapped by production/engineering disability,"Hi there.

I’m a decently proficient musician (if I don’t say so myself...) but my ability to capture, produce, and engineer a digital reflection of my performances these days, despite a quality rig, is embarrassingly poor.  I feel like each piece of equipment and digital tech requires a new skill set on par with learning a whole new instrument and I just don’t have the time or internal impetus. 

My current goal is to have a halfway decent recording of a new album of singer/songwriter material with guitar and vocals (2-4 tracks, 15ish songs).  I want to capture video as well and pair it with the audio.  

These recordings don’t have to be amazing, just decent enough to send to the copywrite office, share with friends and family via YouTube, SoundCloud etc.  Down the road, I’ll may throw a chunk o’ change at a pro studio to do all this for me but for now, I just want to keep it simple, time efficient, cheap(ish) and build some momentum.  

I have the sound I want (or close) live:  guitar, effects, fishman DI, fishman loudbox artist; vocals, Neumann mic, tc helicon processor, fishman loudbox.  

If I try to record directly into my studio recording rig I just can’t get the same sound, mix, vibe, as I do live.  No doubt, this is due to technical ineptness/naïveté. 

How bad an idea is it to just record my live performances with a condenser mic in front of my fishman amp with minimal post production.  Do people do this?

Is this a viable way to reamp a guitar?,"I know the ideal method would be just buying a Reamp box. However, I figured I would try to get around the need by doing this: working on a Focusrite Scarlett 6i6, guitar recorded directly into Logic. After I got the guitar recorded, I made a separate audio track to record into. Then, I got a guitar cable, connected one end to the headphone jack of my interface. The other end went into the input of my guitar amp. Mic’ed up the amp, and I set it to record. I expected that this would be potentially dangerous with feedback, so I made the amp as quiet as possible, because as I expected, after a certain point of loudness I got feedback and almost blew out the speakers. I managed to get the guitar track reamped successfully, but only with the amp playing at about a soft speaking level. I know this is a pretty stupid method, but is there anything different I could do next time to be able to push the amp to a louder level without getting feedback?

SD9 Insert Issues,"Hey there, 
Lately i've been experiencing a strange issue with my DiGiCo SD9. We use a Waves Soundgrid server basically just as a network-based interface to get multi-track audio from to our Livestreaming computer running Logic. The issue has been that lately, it seems certain channels have been un-routing the returns from the SG server.

It took a while to track down what the issue was. I was seeing input on the meters, but couldn't hear anything from that channel on any of the mixes/groups/PFL bus. 

It first happened a few months back on only one channel, and I couldn't figure it out at the time so I just loaded an older session and worked from there and it was fine. This last Sunday though, it un-routed two separate channels (7 &amp; 25). Today when I came in to mix for an event, I had to re-route the inserts on all of my FX returns (37-42).

I haven't been able to find any cause for this really. I know there's the toggle for the insert that's to the right hand of the EQ strip, but if someone were to accidentally bump it, it would only turn off the insert, not actually un-route it. 

Is this something that anyone else has experienced? I know the way that I use the SG server isn't the most typical scenario, but i'm hoping someone can sympathize/tell me why this seems to be happening.

TL;DR random channels are un-routing the insert returns and I can't figure out why.",t2_56ugoku,2,0

Does my vintage speakers Philosophy actually make sense?,"My friend who got me into the audio engineering world always bought vintage speakers and gear. I soon followed. Not only was it more fun to go to flea markets and scour Facebook yard sale sites for this gear then instead of endlessly watching reviews of new bookshelf speakers and so on. Another thing was that the music we liked to play was from those areas. I’m a big Beatles fan and he is a big Rush fan, So We had this idea that using the high end gear from back then (60’s to mid 80’s) would result in getting what the audio was trying to sound like back then. Let me give an example. When rush released their debut album it was 1974 so we wanted to listen to it like it was  1974. We felt the audio was more authentic being played on a pair of speakers from the 70’s. The question I’m asking is does this make sense and does it actually enhance the music or is it just an excuse for me to keep buying vintage gear. Thanks!",t2_25usgyaj,1,0

Here's the quote if anybody's curious: 

&gt; Jack Joseph Puig told me many years ago that he makes a playlist of his favourite sounding mixes, and while he’s mixing he will go to that playlist and switch the input and through the speakers he’s hearing other people’s mixes from records that he really adores and loves, and then he’ll go back to his mix.

Recording Drums : Question,"Hey Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping I could get some helping weighing in on my Choice for recording Drums. (Two Toms, Snare, Kick and Hi-hat and Cymbals)

I am working on recording the drums for our band, and have access to these particular items at the moment

&amp;#x200B;

2 condenser mics ( 2 x AT2020)

4 Dynamic mics ( 2 x SM57s and 2 x SM58s)

&amp;#x200B;

Where it gets a little tricky:

&amp;#x200B;

I own an Avid Mbox 3 Pro (4 inputs) and one of these : \[mono mixers\]([https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01F6PTA04/ref=oh\_aui\_detailpage\_o06\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01F6PTA04/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1))

this is used on my recently built PC (firewire card FTW)

&amp;#x200B;

I also have an Mbox 2 - with Pro tools 8 LE installed on a laptop.

&amp;#x200B;

should I?

A) Solely use the Mbox 3 pro? (so two Overheads P48 in Input 1 and 2, kick in input 3 and use input 4 to run Snare and two Toms on the same input)

or

B) Use the Mbox 3 pro for the Overheads, Kick and snare and use the Mbox 2 for the High tom and Floor Tom?)

&amp;#x200B;

Since both my PC and Laptop have decent specs - and I can import the Tracks from one session to another, I am leaning towards the B - as it would allow me to individually control everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I safe to assume this is the better option?

Recording a drum during practice,"Hi folks. The band I play in is currently discussing the possibility of recording our practice sessions. We're not too concerned with sound quality seeing as this is really just intended to improve our playing in various ways. We already have a digital mixer, and everybody except the drummer is either already plugging into it, or has a cab-simulated DI built-into their amps.

So the major problem that's left to solve is that we need to record a live drummer, while 4 other musicians are playing in the same small practice room at the same time (through amps and a pair of powered speakers). Ideally without spending hundreds of dollars on equipment. 

I have a decent cardioid mic (AT2020) at home that's currently gathering dust. If I point it towards the drum kit and away from everything else, are we going to get a fairly clear recording? Or is it just going to pick up a ton of noise and sound like muddied shit? If so, could we fix this with noise gates, EQing or black magic?

Understanding MIDI set-ups is proving difficult,"I have done a bunch of research trying to answer this myself but a clear answer eludes me given most OPs are unclear what exactly they want answered. I will keep this as pointed as possible, and any help would be greatly appreciated.

**My precise goal:** Use the MIDI out on my regular weighted digital piano (keyboard) into a computer one way or another such that I can use an interface to change the keyboard voices and use the keyboard keys to create drum sounds or whatever else, e.g. G4 might be a cymbal, E4 might be a snare, like a MIDI controller but less user friendly.

**Points of confusion:**

1. I haven't even worked out to what degree that is doable or practical, which I suppose depends whether software like Ableton or whatever can accommodate this easily.

2. Similarly, while expensive, is it easier just to buy a MIDI controller to this end?

They are like, your usual 1/8 headphone TRRS jack and I plugged them into a 1/4 TRS jack adapter and they were not working properly, the sound was quiet for some reason and all, but when I hold any button on the control panel of the earbuds the sound turns normal. I guess it's because there's both mic and headphones on single jack and trying to connect it to a TRS (not TRRS) adapter causes the 'buds to malfunction. Soooo, my question is, is it safe for the interface to plug headphones like that in? Or will fucking around with the jacks fuck the interface up?  


EDIT: tl;dr will connecting 4 pole 1/8 headphone jack into 3 pole 1/4 adapter fry my interface?",t2_8lm1n,2,0
Three mic drum recording question,"I'm setting up a semi-permanent mic mix for a performance space/live room at my house and would like some opinions. I'm going to run the bass direct off the DI, I have a Sennheiser E609 mics on the cabs of both guitar amps and am running a stereo sub-mix of vocals from Shure SM58s. All tracks are going into a FocusRite Scarlett 18i20 with a computer set up strictly for recording to Reaper.

We have occasional open mics, open jams and house shows for which we will be recording audio to mix down and send to a video feed. That leaves me three channels remaining for the drum mic setup without adding on additional preamps via optical (Which I may do down the line).

I have a Shure Beta 52A, two Blue Sparks, two SM57s and four Blue Encore 100is available in my arsenal. To create as clean a mix as possible would I be better off micing the kick with the 52A, snare with one of the Encores (or an SM57) and a single Spark as a room mic or micing the kick and using the additional two channels to set up the Sparks in an XY pattern overhead?

The room is about 30'x70' and the stage area is 10'x20' in the Northwest corner with a brick wall behind the stage. We have two Alto TS212s and a sub for the mains and two Yorkville 12"" monitors flown from the ceiling angled at 60 degrees from parallel to the floor and the room has minimal sound treatment.",t2_69j4p,1,0
CAD D189,"Anyone here have any experience with this microphone?

I bought it hoping that frequency response was as listed on Amazon, 40-18k Hz (with an impedance of 200). Yet, in an email conversation with the CAD Service Department, their official specs are the 40-18k version. Could I have gotten a typo and returned a bang-for-your-buck microphone by accident?

Podcast post production,"I’ve been asked to do post production on a friend’s podcast. There were three people each on an SM58 recorded into a Zoom hard disc recorder in a flat (apartment) with no acoustic treatment.

As I’ve put compression on them, it’s all started to sound a bit boxy as the room bleed has been picked up by each other’s mics. I tried gating but the signal strength varies so much as they move back and forth from the mic that it cuts too much out or does nothing at all.

I’ve EQed each channel but the box I was is coming from the mics that aren’t in use at that time. The podcast is 45 mins long so too long to do automation. Anybody got any ideas to get a decent sound (save re-recording the whole thing in an actual studio!)

Roland RE-501: what to look for when assessing condition,"Hey there,

"Arranging a track that is mostly guitars, tone, effects, etc.","Hey guys,

I am working on some tracks that have most of their harmonic content coming from guitars ( 2+ different chord inversions, and rhythms of extended chords, and one bass guitar). This is more of a general question, but I am wondering how you fill out an arrangement for a song that is mostly guitar? To my ears, there's a certain narrowness to the electric guitar playing chords that something like an electric piano Rhodes sound doesn't have. Narrow in width but also frequency content. A thinness that a few interlocking synth chords doesn't have. When combined in a full arrangement, with keys and maybe strings or pads and other instruments, guitars do a nice job of accentuating certain parts of the harmony through chord stabs and fills, but when it is just guitar, it seems to not fill the wide frequency range that a piano or keys would, and it also doesn't have an attack that naturally lends itself to 'holding down' an arrangement as well either. And this is coming from someone who has played guitar for 15 years. I know my instrument and I know it's short comings. I am also wondering how you manage arrangement situations as far as what effects, and 'differences' you put on the guitars to make them fill out an arrangement - or what playing style in comparison to the other you encourage.So how do you deal with a creating a song that has that fullness but is harmonically carried only by electric guitars?

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Im going for a sort of R&amp;B/Soul/smooth jazz sound. A lot of guitar recommendations for production come for things that in my head make sense in a two distorted guitar panned hard type scenario, sort of a rock/metal world if you will. And that's cool. I've done that to success before. But I'd rather have someone think in the lines of these genres I'm mentioning (which in my mind rely heavily on the E.Piano sounds to carry the harmony) and think again how this can be achieved with just guitars. Thanks!",t2_4nja4,1,0
What do you all use for sound absorption/diffusion?,"Hi everyone, sorry in advance if this isn’t the right sub to post this in. 
I have a second story garage ‘studio’ that needs some TLC as far as sound absorption goes. This space is used as a practice area for my band, as well as where I work on editing music. Of course, no young persons studio is complete without a neighbor who absolutely hates the sound leakage. I know the first thing people might recommend is to find a new place to practice, but at this time that’s not an option for me, unfortunately. I understand that there’s no way to completely soundproof the room, but I have a very thick blanket in front of and around the drums and I recently purchased some safe n sound rockwool, which I’m planning on making panels with this week. I’m sure some people here have made some panels with rockwool, so I was mainly wondering what kind of fabric will work best for wrapping the panels once the frames are built. This is important for me to know as I’ve heard a lot of different suggestions. 

Also if you guys have any other suggestions as to what I could do to contain some (or most) of the sound, I’m open to anything! My band stops practice at 9, since the town I live in has no sound ordinance, so we abide by the sound law of the state that we live in. My neighbor must have crazy good hearing because when I stood outside while my drummer played, I could barely, and I mean barely hear the drums, which seem to be the main problem. However I am saving up for some curtains that should help a lot. Bass and guitar volume are kept at the bare minimum they need to be at to accommodate the drums. Mixing isn’t really a problem as far as the neighbor hearing it because I don’t need to mix at a high volume. I’m just trying to have a productive band practice without upsetting anybody. 

Thanks for reading, and sorry for the long post. I look forward to hearing what you guys have to say! ",t2_wyoqu,1,0
Hey! I need tips/feedback (no pun intended) on a session I got tomorrow regarding mic placement mostly.,"**The Instrument:**

One solo B^b clarinet (possibly also the same guy playing an E^b for other pieces)

**The Hardware:**

I have the following at my disposal: 

- Audix i5 (x1)
- Audix D6 (x1)
- Audix D2 (x2)
- Audix D4 (x1)
- Audix ADX51 (x2)
- Shure SM57 (x1)
- MXL V250 (x1)

**The Software** which I doubt matters:

Logic Pro X (yeah I know)

**The Room:**

Not many details on this. I'm given to understand it's made for medium-sized choral performances and acoustically 'treated' for such purposes. 

**The Purpose:**

It's for an audition tape, so it doesn't have to be stellar quality. I do want it to be good though, and I think it needs to be/want it to be achieved through good mic placement first and foremost.

**The Plan:**

- mic clarinetist with the MXL V250, since I think a large-diaphragm condenser mic is gonna get the best frequency range
- place MXL V250 about a foot away from the upper center of the instrument itself, because the player tends to move around when he's performing and because I'm given to understand that placing the mic upwards of center is going to deliver the best sound (other than that I only really know that mic'ing the bell is a bad call)
- Possibly place the ADX51s in XY at a height of about 6-6.5' behind the performer to capture the room ambience, depending on how the room sounds (this is my biggest point of uncertainty, I'm not sure if rear placement is good or if I should place them in the opposite end of the room or anything like that)

Anything you can tell me about what I'm doing right or wrong would be of massive help! I'm looking for any and all input on techniques of any relevant kind really, I'm new to this whole sort of thing.

Issues with live drums: drum and bass producer,"I make drum and bass which consists basically of drums, both synthesized and acoustic, and bass (synthetic, not acoustic).

My goal is to get decent at making breaks (using drum software like superior Drummer 3 to make pseudo recordings of real drumming) to use in songs. I don't need the acoustic drums to be as heavy as synthesized ones, I just need them to not disappear completely in the mix yet not be super synthetic. I can't overstate how loud my songs are. But I also don't want to be using dubstep snares at 170+ BPM. Drum breaks give some life to extremely mechanical music.

I'm decent at most other engineering stuff so thats not the issue. Overall, I can get satisfying mixes if using synthesized elements only for bass + drums.

 I have a hard time getting acoustic drums to sound good. 

Summary:

I have a hard time getting some loudness/harmonic content out of raw drums without obliterating the naturalness of the recording. I have no clue how other producers can make such excellently processed acoustic drums.

Issues with body/tail:

They're either too boomy with long tails if I enable bleed and use surround channels, or they are too fake sounding if I use volume envelopes. Release times for kicks/Tom's are super long by default, it's hard to get things snappy enough for high BPMs yet not fake 

Frequency spectrum issues:

The raw drum sounds are very quiet in a heavy song: little top end, low peaks, etc. So I will add some distortion ranging from tube to tape to waveshaping. But then everything just sounds harsh.

I'm using superior Drummer 3 which should give me enough technical choices to not have these issues so I think the real issue is just skill. I have more tools at my disposal than most famed engineers of the past. Basically anything that can be done with drums, I can do easily, except I am a drum noob.

Who here uses Izotope for mastering? What’s in your chain and in what order?,"Mastering isn’t my strong suit, but I can at least get my tracks sounding how I want them to sound finished and at a good level. 

For awhile, my chain went EQ, dynamics, exciter (minimal usage), stereo imager, then maximizer.

Annoying Gain Staging Question,"Hi All - 

Something's been stuck on my mind regarding gain staging. I fully understand the concepts of gain staging, headroom, analog domain, -18dbfs = 0VU, etc. We all know that it's important to give yourself plenty of headroom and have proper levels running into analog-modeled plugins... my question is, in the digital DAW realm, is it possible to have too low levels running into these plugins?

For instance, can you run your levels too low, say into an analog modeled channel strip, that the signal is no longer picks up the sonic influence, or ""analog sound"" of the plugin? Or are we fine just clip gaining everything down to get to a reasonable level (0VU) on the mix buss and call it good, when perhaps the high hat layer is sitting at -12VU, far below the ""ideal working conditions"" of the plugin?

History Question: why are old recordings so overdriven?,"I think this every year when I start listening to Christmas music, finally gonna ask someone. I’m not an pro audio engineer but I understand a bit.

Many old audio recordings (actually old, like 30s &amp; 40s; consider Bing Crosby’s early stuff) sound overdriven, but why is that? What were the OG audio engineers doing “wrong” and what improvements in recording equipment and techniques most corrected that problem?

I’m specifically wondering where the problem(s) were in the process. Were microphones just that bad and over-sensitive back then? Was it that the amps and preamps couldn’t handle any substantial signal? Did engineers not understand clipping? I’ve heard compression technology wasn’t utilized for a long time; was “loud parts clip” just the accepted trade-off for “gotta hear the quiet parts”? Was it a limitation of the tapes or vinyl being recorded to? Or is it some inherent issue in re-recording to newer formats (i.e. there was no distortion on the original record, but it showed up when they started transferring to CDs, etc)?

Question regarding mix bus compression,"Lately my process is to keep individual track below around -6 db, and I have been utilizing lots of busses. For example a drum bus with all of my drums and percussion, and a music bus with all musical tracks. Then a vocal bus as well. These all get sent to a mix bus, which I compress and then use make up gain to push the mix into a limiter. Even though my individual tracks + busses are down between -9 and -6, the mix bus adds up and peaks a lot closer to zero (before the compression+limiting I mean).

Does this mean I am not getting the full amount of headroom I could be taking advantage of? Should the mix bus ideally be peaking closer to the peaks of the individual tracks/busses, so I can get more out of the compression + limiting? Is this something I can achieve through better leveling, better EQ? My mixes have been a lot louder than in the past so I think I’m on the right track, but I’m not sure.

I've tried everything from reverbs, delays, saturations, eq, comps, etc
The best solution I have ATM is to double it and pan it hard left and right but I'm not sure if that's the best route?

Any tips? Should I just be ok with the fact that sometimes instruments are ""felt"" more than heard in some mixes?

Why does my voice sound different in every single recording?,"I record and edit a podcast where I am the host, and I've been puzzled for a while why it is that every time I make a recording it sounds so completely different.

Level standardisation at -20dB below MSB??,"Hi all, Im currently working on a uni project where i am designing a room for mixing cinema sound that conforms to dolby specifications. Im reading through the dolby specs and Im a bit stumped because it is using an acronym (MSB) that i haven't seen before and it isn't defined in the document. Here it is in context:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Level standardisation at -20dB below MSB or clip in the console main outputs and recorders is essential. You may wish to check with the manufacturer that digital and line levels conform to the accepted standards i.e. +4dBu or 0dBu line level for -20dBFS internal console level and the meters read -20dB.""*

The Effects of Putting a Speaker in a Box,"I apologize it this post isn't relevant to this sub. Feel free to remove it if so.

So I live above a food place in a very old building and the manager recently installed speakers in the ceiling...directly under my bed. And they love to play music late at night. 

He claims to have built a box around the speaker in the ceiling that will insulate the noise, but as far as my understanding goes that'll just amplify the noise and as long as it's still attached to beams in a ceiling that isn't insulated it won't really effect the reverb that rattles my floors. Am I wrong? What would be a solution to this? Is it not having speakers in the ceiling? Or is there a viable way to deaden sound in one direction without losing too much in the opposite direction?

How do you guys apply reverb?,"Hey,
I’m fairly new to mixing and trying to figure out how to apply reverb to my mixes.
I make mostly hip hop and EDM.


The way I do it is:
Set up 3 or more send buses. One short, one medium and one long.

I use the same reverb plugin on all three, but adjust the length; predelay time; EQ curve and wideness to get different ”depths” on each bus.

The shorter ones have longer predelay, narrower wideness and more of the higher frequencies.

Than I send my tracks (drums, melody, whatever) to the appropriate buses, with appropriate send levels and put EQ/compression to the buses.


What do you think? Is this a good approach?
Should I change something/switch my approach entirely?

Anybody run two separate side chains for kick and snare?,"First off, I'm mixing for loudness. 

I'm currently making a dubstep track, where the main elements in focus are kick + snare, bass synths and my sub bass. 

Recently I've been finding it harder to get my single sidechain rack (sidechaining both kick and snare under the same curve), to effectively duck my synths enough so that the dynamic range is minimal.

What's happening is that when my kick hits, my sidechain ducks the synths fine and I'm at -10 with both playing, while then the snare hits the master peaks at -5.

Question is it common practice to use two separate sidechain curves, as in a short cut for the kick, and more gradual for the snare?

I'm looking for more of an answer than to just turn the snare down as that's obvious.

Note: Both kick and snare are soft clipped and peaking at -10.

How accurately could I measure the noise ambience of a room with just a smartphones microphone?,"I know I might be able to do an accurate measurement if I did a proper 'experiment'; put my phone in the perfect position, don't be in the room during the recording, etc. But what if I wanted to record my room's ambience for 24 hours straight in background casually? Would I be able to distinguish between a noise happening outside vs inside? Would I even be able to pick up a noise coming from outside the room or house? Of course it depends on the structure of the room. I guess I might be able to filter out certain noises that the phone may pick up such as the phone vibrating due to a message, or maybe even snoring. 

I suppose I'm just curious if there are too many random variables to account for to do this casually rather than setting up the proper equipment to measure something like this accurately. Also, if there is a better sub to post this to, let me know.

Seeking Advice On Prepping For Home Drum Tracking,"Howdy fellow sound geeks, I come seeking advice on prepping for some drum recordings.

some background: I'm 19 still living with my parents and I've been putting together an amateur studio. Over new years my family are going abroad and I've opted to stay for a number of reasons, one of them being having the house to myself to work on music while I have time off work. Over this time period I'm hoping to get some drums recorded for commercial release for my own music.

&amp;#x200B;

The current plan is to move my drum kit into the family kitchen/living space (a large, very reflective and bright room. It's kinda rectangular with alot of uneven surfaces and angles) in the hopes to get quite a big but controlled room sound.

&amp;#x200B;

As it stands the kit configuration will be:

\-Pearl decade maple kit (only mid and low tom, fusion sizes)

\-Ludwig 402 Snare

\-Paiste 402 Hi hat and ride (using the ride to crash)

&amp;#x200B;

And mic config will be:

\-Shure dm112 kick (facing into the hole of the kick)

\-SM57 snare top &amp; bottom close mics

\-RVD9 dynamic mics on toms

\-RV4 Pencil condensor mics (spaced pair)

\-Neumann u87ai room mic, placed low to the ground to avoid cymbal noise

\-sm58 crush/energy mic

&amp;#x200B;

Overheads going into a art tps II pre tube preamp and the rest going into a behringer ultragain

&amp;#x200B;

I also have 4 ikea bookshelves stuffed with rockwool intended to treat my mixing space that I could use as baffles

&amp;#x200B;

I intend on moving stuff around to find sweet spots and what sounds best but I'm looking for advice that would help. Mainly surrounding the OH and room mic config

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts are I could use the u87ai as a mono overhead because I know from past experience that it tends to respond well to the paiste 2002 cymbals and get my stereo imaging from stereo room mics and toms. Alternatively, I do have a small bit of budget and could rent out a pair of coles 4038's as overheads and keep the 87 as a room mic.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: should I jump straight in and rent the coles or try the other two configs first? Where would people recommend placement of a mono overhead? where should I place baffles? currently my thinking is have the drummer face lengthways down the room (its kinda rectangular) with the baffles either side and behind and room mics on the other end of the room.

&amp;#x200B;

The style of drums I am aiming for is like tight disco stuff but with a big room vibe

Recording a figure 8 ribbon on guitar cab in an untreated bedroom. What to expect?,"Edit: if anyone wants to tell me why this got downvoted I’d be happy to listen.


Hi everyone,

There are surrounding circumstances that I can address if need be but I'd like to get straight to the point! For clarity, I am still in the beginning of my journey as an amateur recording engineer, but I'm closer to intermediate than a novice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a sennheiser e906 that I close mic on my deluxe reverb, and it is miles better (to my ears) than the sm58 I was using previously. Based on the sounds I'm looking for, I would like add a second mic (Cascade Fathead ribbon most likely). In my untreated bedroom, I use a portable vocal shield to reject some of the null frequencies. I'm in college so I move frequently and have limited space. Ideally, hard core acoustic treatment is off the table.

Given a ribbon microphones figure 8 pattern, would a bedroom guitarist be wasting their time and money in an untreated room? Would a vocal shield positioned directly on the opposite side of the sound source be pointless?

Maybe one of you can help me out.

Right now I'm recreating Hans Zimmer's *Interstellar* \-- lots of orchestral sounds, many plug-ins, effects, the whole bit. There is very little latency from midi keyboard to Serum, other plugins -- I'd say it's responsive enough to play in real time without any issue. Song is about 2 min long.

The other song I'm working on, however, has crazy latency. It's an electronic dance song with lots of bass and synth -- it *was* a pretty dense with effects and so on, before I froze all tracks and converted to audio. Now there's only 5 audio tracks, yet the latency is still very high. (I should add that I've used Ozone 8 to master the track, but I don't see that as the issue because Interstellar is mastered just the same.) Song is about 2 min long.

Why are echo and reverb so different to one another? Don’t they won’t the same way?,"In practise echo is a delayed repetition of the sound like when you should ‘hello’ at the mountains and hear it back a few times. Reverb is a long decay of a sound like water droplets in a cave where the sound lasts longer than the droplet and resonates all around. 

But in many real life instances, there is both echo AND reverb in a space like a cathedral for example. 

Don’t reverb and echo work by the sound reflecting off surfaces? What causes reverb as opposed to an echo and how are they technically different? ",t2_141p1u5k,52,0

"Do you think there are some things that are inherently wrong in music production, or can anything and everything be pulled off in the right context?","There are so many artists and albums that found their calling, niche, or created a legacy through some form of 'breaking the rules' - too many to list. Then again, I feel like there are some things which would be hard to make sound 'right', or otherwise sound like they were done intentionally or creatively.

I'm not thinking about definitive traits of genres like noise music here. As an example, one thing in particular that often crosses my mind is the presence of anything resembling a 'pop' or phase glitch out of place. Again, glitch music is entirely based around the use of 'glitchy', distorted, or otherwise 'accidental' type sounds. Again, some songs make a feature, or pastiche out of vinyl/tape crackle or hiss - this is an aesthetic choice and again, perfectly okay in my eyes. But I've heard a couple of otherwise well produced songs with the presence of an extremely transient high frequency 'pop' (much like you'd get if you forgot to fade out a region ending on a non-zero-crossing) and it seems far too obvious to have simply been a mistake. This is one thing that simply just sounds plain *wrong*, bad even, to my ears. Another one would be 'muddy' sounding frequency clashes of distinct sounds, but perhaps the jury's more out on that one.

What are you guys' thoughts on this?

*Side note: I have enjoyed plenty of things written/produced by Animal Collective, but Danse Manatee is just about the most offensive-sounding production I've ever heard committed to tape. The overwhelming reliance on/presence of extremely trebly harmonic content from the get-go was an affront to my ears. IMHO, there's a good reason people don't tend to that in music. It sounds terrible. YMMV.*

Converting recorded drums to MIDI,"Hey all, if there's a better place to ask this question, please let me know.

I have a drum recording that I am trying to convert to MIDI and then run through a VST (KVLT Drums). Reason being that I'm finally biting the bullet and doing my own drum arrangements for my band's EP, but I have one track that we got a real drum recording of, but I want the consistency of having the drums on each track sound the same. There's no way I'm skilled enough to replicate the recording into MIDI by hand, so I thought I would be able to just route the tracks (10 of them in the recording) into MIDI channels to receive sampling from the plug-in.

I'm using Ableton Live 9, which I know is not the ideal DAW for a lot of things, but it's what I'm familiar with and what I have. Ableton's biggest downside imo is that many things which seem relatively easy to do in other programs have a clunky or un-intuitive work-around in Live--maybe I'm just missing something.

Anyway, I'm not sure that I can do this (routing audio recordings into my VST) without something convoluted like slicing each recording/channel to a new MIDI track, tidying it up (there is of course some mic bleed), tweaking velocity etc etc etc., and then routing it to the VST. 

Just looking for some tips to streamline this process before I go ahead and sink a bunch of hours into it the hard way. Thanks!",t2_fz61s,0,0

How did you break into the audio engineering industry?,"Hey all,

I read through the FAQ and I didn't really see anything on the topic of entering an audio engineering and/or sound design career with an electrical engineering background or existing degree in a sort of relevant field, so I'm going to pitch a couple different questions here to anyone who has some insight. I did find a couple related old postings, but I figure it's worth asking the community again.

Basically, I am a hobbyist music producer and have been for a couple of years. My main work however is as an electrical engineer, designing circuits and working with them at a major tech company. Life as a techie is getting to me, and I find myself devoting more and more of my time and energy to music. Now, I have a degree in signal processing which strikes me as at least a bit relevant to the field; will that help me at all to get a job with a studio? The more people I talk to in the audio engineering and sound design world the more I get the feeling that it's something I want to learn more about on the career side, I just am not quite sure where to start. I'm not asking for links to job postings, I'm more asking how you initially got into the industry and where you came from before it; what was your process from when you realized you wanted to work in this field? If you don't have a degree related to audio engineering, what did you do to make yourself hire-able? One more that's a bit unrelated, do any of you work as sound designers for audio companies? I met somebody who does sound design for commercials, games, etc &amp; I'm curious what the day to day work life looks like for that kind of job.

Thanks in advance, I've really enjoyed lurking on this sub and I've learned a ton of great techniques here. Any advice you have is majorly appreciated.

Sax/flute player using small mixer on stage,"What's up nerds! I have recently started gigging with a pedalboard for my sax (octaver, envelope filter, compressor, delay, reverb). I go from a Shure wireless into the pedals and out through a DI into the house mixer. 

I also have a vocal/flute mic ( Senn e935) that I would like to run through the same pedals (especially for the compressor and reverb). The best idea I've come up with is using a small mixer with an effects loop to send both of my mics through the pedalboard and still have 2 seperate channels so the sound person can mix the channels independently.
A benefit would be the ability to EQ myself from stage in a club where there is no sound person or no competent one (a few of the clubs I play regularly) and maybe even use the onboard reverb instead of a pedal. It seems I would also no longer need a DI? Is this a viable setup or am I missing something?

Field Recording Troubles,"I've been working on a small game development project with some friends and I have been handling sound design for them.

Compression - Volume Matching and Makeup Gain,"Hey guys!

So I've been mixing for a while now but one thing I'm still yet to fully understand is makeup gain after compression. I understand that its purpose is to add back volume through the compressor after gain reduction, but my question is this: 

Are you meant to be adding enough makeup gain to match the reduction in gain? I.e. if there is -6.4db gain reduction at a vocal's loudest point, am I adding around 6db of makeup gain? 

OR

Am I simply adding enough makeup gain to match the level of the original vocal before processing occurred. I ask because If I add as much makeup gain as is being reduced, the vocal comes out as a much louder product generally speaking.

If I added 3db makeup gain on a vocal with -6db vocal reduction at its peak, that is usually enough to match the volume of the track prior to compression.

It's louder at night, only in winter and comes and goes over long periods, like several hours. I have some theories, but this isn't about that. Anyway, in order to analyse, I have two 15"" bass amplifiers plugged in as microphones which work beautifully, one in the basement on the floor and one on the first floor of the house. I can view a real-time stereo spectrogram using Adobe Audition 1.5 recording at only 441 Hz. I picked this frequency because it's 1/100th the normal sample rate that I use AND I can see a beautiful high resolution spectrogram at 2048 bands appear live of only low frequency audio showing everything up to 220 Hz. It only looks good after about 5 minutes, as it needs to show some duration for the sake of sharpness.  I'm looking to further analyse this and improve the quality of the analysis. I also have some distant noises coming in in higher frequencies recorded at higher sampling rates that I wish to isolate using whatever Noise Reduction tools I can find. So far I have tried various combinations of applications and plugins including:

\-Built in Noise Reduction using Adobe Audition 1.5

\-Built in Noise Reduction using Adobe Audition 3

\-Built in Noise Reduction using Adobe Audition CC2015

\-Izotope RX 5

\-Izotope Ozone 8

\-SpectraLayers Pro 5 (One of the best)

\-Spear

\-ISSE

\-PRAAT

\-ARSS

\-Waves WNS

\-Waves X-Noise

\-Waves Z-Noise

Acon Restoration - Acon's De-hum is THE best live de-hum effect I have found. (up to 96 harmonics with live attenuation + odd only option)

Diamond Cut Forensics 10 - DCF's De-hum is THE best post-processing de-hum effect (up to 400 harmonics + odd only option)

Sound It! 8 Pro, which comes with the Sonnox Restoration Bundle

And even Celemony Melodyne 4 for selecting unwanted partials to remove which works surprisingly well.

**But today I had an idea** and I needed to post this and share because the best ideas seem to come from thinking outside of the box. What I did was this:

I used an old audio effect program called HOG v0.71b to load a .wav recording and convolve it. The trick is:

**1**\- Take the .wav sample with the quiet BG sound you wish to isolate and slow it way way down, to like 40x slower than the original. Be sure to re-sample and NOT time-stretch. Ugh.

**2**\- Load the 40x slower version into HOG. Convolve it using the following parameters:

\----INPUT: (Load your slowed down .wav sample here)

\----IMPULSE: (Load your slowed down .wav sample here) -yes the same file. we will self-convolve.

\----OUTPUT: (Name your new file whatever makes sense for you)

Turn on MOVING, BRIGHTEN and 32 BIT NORMALIZE -No scale impulse, no mix back input.

WINDOW: Blackman\_Harris

IMPULSE LENGTH: 0.25 (length is measured in seconds)

PROCESS it!

**3**\- Open your output .wav and re-sample it back to the original duration and viola!

It is a **new method of Noise Reduction.**

**Note1**: Best for use on very quiet sounds among background ""air"" sound.

**Note2**: Horrible for use on clarifying garbled speech or differentiating speech among other people (BTW, if anyone knows methods for how to do that, LET ME KNOW!) Best I've tried so far is manually selecting using adobe audition CC2015 and SpectraLayers.

**REQ1**: If anyone tries this method and discovers better settings along the way or interesting ideas, please share! That's what this post is for! 😃

**REQ2**: If anyone knows any other rare or interesting audio restoration or just any interesting effects similar to these please share that as well. I'm on the lookout for more methods. I know about Cedar Studio 7. I just cant afford it. I wish there was a trial version I could use 😉, but I can't find one, so that's another thing I'm looking for. I'm determined to improve this setup, and I'm happy to help anyone with ideas or wishing to make a similar setup.

Does the attack &amp; release parameters affect the compressor after the the threshold has been reached?,Pretty simple question. Once the threshold has been crossed does the attack and release change anything about how the sound is being compressed? for example if I have a sustained sound that has a low threshold where the sound is always having gain reduction applied to it will the attack and release only determine the initial and end moments of the sound or will it affect the sound during its sustain? very difficult to explain without a picture.,t2_gl707,1,0
Some questions about mastering from someone who's only focused on mixing,"I've always been under the impression that a good mix is all you need. All of my compression is done in the production stage so when it comes to mastering all I do it put it through a limiter... however many people I've talked to say that mastering is an important part and not to overlook it so I have some questions I can't find the answers to elsewhere:

1. If my dynamics are already smoothed out in the production phase, and my RMS is good, do I really need to do anything else other than running it though a limiter?


2. I'm trying mastering with a multiband compressor to smooth things out more, should there be gain reduction applied all the time or just for the loudest parts? The songs I make have very aggressive and over-compressed sections as well as quiet and very dynamic sections. If my compressors are engaging for the quiet sections how do I stop it from smashing the signal for the loud parts? Or do you use a very low ratio/high knee to counteract this?

Where is unity gain on a interface that uses a digital volume control (no stepped resistors)?

Maintaining sample rate while shifting pitch?,"Hey friends, 

I'm a software guy, I know absolutely nothing about audio engineering really, and I have a quick question. I'm currently working on a little software project that uses multiple .wav files and strings them all together in to one large .wav.

The problem: The .wav files do not all have the same sample rate. I am working with 22050hz, 44100hz and 88200hz files. When these are combined in to one master file, I must assign a sample rate to it.

If I assign the master file a rate of 44100hz, the 22050hz portions are suddenly playing twice as fast and play an octave higher than intended.

So, how do I either change the sample rates of the files without affecting the pitch/duration of the file, or how do I change the pitch of the file while maintaining sample rate and duration?

Thanks so much friends, I hope to post the finished project when complete!


EDIT: Got it figured out based on aasteveo's response using Audacity, HOWEVER!!!!!! !!!!If you want to actually export the audio at the desired sample rate you must change the ""Project Rate (Hz): "" dropdown menu in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Simply resampling the file and exporting it does not change the rate! ",t2_ivqqi,0,0

Playing With A Click Track/Metronome,"Hey guys, I'm not on reddit too terribly much so I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in.

We have a problem, and it is this: our vocalists like to drag and our drummer likes to rush. It's a bad problem, and I know that it could be fixed quite simply if they would have a metronome in their ear, but that's proven to be more difficult than I thought. The drummer does have in-ears, nobody else does, but I can get that setup easily enough, we do have the equipment. I've tried to play a click through the drummer's in-ears only, and it works for a short amount of time (while the song isn't loud yet), but as soon as the song gets big and everyone's playing loudly, he loses the click in his headphones to other instruments and strays off badly. If I turn it up in the beginning so I know he can hear it when everyone else is playing, he says it's deafeningly loud. What are your suggestions for me so that the drummer would be able to clearly hear the click all the way through without deafening him in the beginning?

OTT on every track ?,"Hello everyone , i want to achieve a commercial loudness for my mix. I'm struggling and feel that i miss something.

Then they start to balance the tracks and then they push the limiter up , turning into a loud mix (-9 / -8 lufs ) .

Is ok to use OTT on almost everything ? , i mean :

why should i use it on a clap , on a kick , these are percussive elements , does the compression make a huge difference ?

"Pre amp quest, UA question.","Hey there everyone,

Had a couple of questions here and would really appreciate any help.

I’ve got an Apollo twin MKII, SM7b, cloudlifter and an AKG414  XLS.

I’ve recently noticed if I’m compressing a quieter source such as a finger acoustic or a whispery/soft vocal with the SM7b I get a pretty dramatic noise floor sound. Very loud hissing. I can get away with softer sounds using one of the condensers, which I’m aware are better than dynamics for softer signals anyway. 

However, I started to crank the Apollo pres to see when noise floor starts to show up (-60db and up) and it starts when I get the Apollo gain about 35% up. Gets worst as it goes and at 60% it’s pretty loud and I’d say with compression and eq and a soft signal it’s going to be noticeable in a mix.

My questions are :

A. Are the Apollo pres known to be noisey?
B. Are the Apollo pres cheap or less then wanted pres.
C. Would I benefit much in way of clean head room and less noise at higher again levels with a 3rd party pre such as an ISA ONE or a WA73?

Question about how console (non-DAW) mix settings are recorded &amp; reproduced.,"When a multitrack recording is mixed on an analog console, do the engineers make notes about all the levels/pan/EQ/compression, etc. of each channel (all 24 or whatever) so that if the song or album is ever remixed, they can at least start with the original mix settings? 

Also, when a recording is remastered, do engineers ever start with the multi-track 2"" tape, re-creating the original mix settings somehow (for instance, if the answer to my first question is yes) in order to step back one stage of tape transfer from the stereo masters, reducing hiss by one generation?  That seems like the ideal process for high-fidelity AAD &amp; DAD remasters, although obviously a lot more work, and maybe not worth the trouble, since there is so little hiss added by tape machines of that quality level.

"Where did the egg-box myth start, and why does it persist?","Hello. I’m an avid guitarist/pianist/singer. I got the home recording bug aged around 12, and it’s been an incredibly rewarding journey - learning how to do one thing leads to the awareness of another thing to learn, and over time you find yourself slowly becoming better and better, the educational process becoming richer and richer.

My latest obsession, and something I have arrived at very late, is acoustics. I knew that some rooms instinctively sounded better than others - not just from a music-making perspective but in everyday life - but I had no idea what went into making the better ones sound better and worse ones sound worse.

I’ve spent the last few months devouring anything I can find on the topic, as well as experimenting with building my own bass traps and acoustic panels and just trying to listen to every room I spend time in and wonder why each one has the character it does.

I work in a music shop which doubles as a 4-room tuition studio. The rooms were not designed for music - some of them sounded downright nasty, and after learning some stuff over the past few months I convinced my boss that we needed to do something. He built some broadband absorbers from rockwool, wrapped in this very arty music notation fabric, and we carpeted the 2 rooms that had tiled floors. It’s far from perfect but we’ve improved the sound of every room.

When I first mentioned solving this problem to my boss, he and his wife agreed but both separately said “Of course, we could stick egg boxes all over the walls, but that wouldn’t look very good...”

And students who have seen the new (very attractive panels) and remarked at the improvement of sound in the rooms have mentioned egg boxes, and how that’s “what you normally see” and isn’t it nice that my boss made these attractive panels.

I’ve done enough research to know that egg boxes aren’t even worth thinking about. 

My question is: Why are they the first thing that comes to people’s minds when they think about improving room acoustics, and why won’t the myth die?

Cutting The Cord,"I don't know if this will resonate with many of you here but maybe for some it will. This is primarily aimed at those who do pro bono mix work for people in order to skill up in their journey.

I started with this whole thing back in the 90s, not seriously but enough for it to be a solid time to start making mistakes for long enough to learn from them. 

Over time I started putting myself out there as a ""free mix engineer"" for various bands and artists I'd meet online and invariably they were interesting but something of a challenge in the performance and recording department which always resulted in a lot of work to get even passable results.

This began to snowball into friendships and unpaid obligations. While I was never really in it for the money and I never wanted to do this as a career, the feeling that I needed to keep practicing to become better for my own music was a blinder to what I was allowing to happen.

I was mixing garage bands, random artists of various genres, and spending entire weekends just trying to unfuck the worst of disasters. I got pretty good at doing that considering the starting point but the price was a lot of time taken away from my own life sitting there trying to prove something to myself that doesn't even matter in my own scope. At some point you learn how to use the tools and then you are at risk of becoming stifled by the context in which you're using them if you limit yourself to it.

I say this to those of you who are no longer learning from that free work you're putting out there and find yourself repeatedly fixing easily avoidable mistakes and feeling trapped by an expectation you're no longer getting anything out of: 

Let it go. It's done. Wish them well and move on. They are holding you back from whatever you're trying to do. If your goal is to do this as a living, dive in that pool, don't keep trying to perfect your backstroke in a bathtub. Do what it is that you're keeping those people around to try and convince yourself you're capable of doing, the moment you have stopped learning from that experience.

EQ Gain makes drums dull? Weird problem!,"Hi.  
Straight to the point. I use GarageBand.  

&amp;nbsp;


  
Problem:  

EQed a drummer track with slight LP and HP filter and a few moves to bring up the kick.  
  
To match input and output levels I turned down the EQ gain so the max peaks and average peaks would hit almost exactly where they'd hit with the EQ off. 

&amp;nbsp;


  
  
When A/Bing EQ on vs off I noticed that despite the peaks being the same the track sounds dull / less powerful.. mostly because the snare felt supressed.  
  
Turned off each EQ point one after another but the dullness remained. Only after bringing the gain back to 0db the drums came back to life.  

&amp;nbsp;


  
Now, why is the EQ gain doing this? There are no plugins after the EQ. It's the last in the plugin chain. No automation, no busses etc.  
  
Is this some GB mystery bug (already discovered a few of those) or what is going on?

Hope someone can help me.",t2_1loj6z6a,2,0
Audio Crisis,"Hey all, In short, I'm a  journalist and I just did a 30-minute phone interview with an author (and I used the ACR call recording app to record it).

Stopping plosives and pops when recording. Have a pop filter and good mic placement,"Recently purchased a mic. Mojave ma201fet

So the mic is awesome.

But only issue is that when I start recording, the very first sound i make when recording the verse is always loud. It ""pops"".

For example if the first word of my verse is ""damn"" the ""d"" sound will pop. If the word is ""clock"" the ""cluh"" noise will be loud and pop.

 The rest of the verse is completely fine. It's just that first word.

Any idea what might be causing this issue?

I have a pop filter. And this was never an issue with my old microphone, an mxl v67g

I have the low roll off enabled and I don't stand too close to the mic either.

Yet no matter what, the first word of my verse always starts with a pop.

I always have to automate the fader to reduce the plosive sounds when mixing.

Strange sensation in left ear,"TL;DR: Strange muscle spasm feeling in my left ear, don't know what it is.

I take relatively good care of my ears, I follow all the standard routines and stuff to stop ear fatigue and damage but this has been bothering me slightly lately.
You know when you're incredibly tired or stressed and get random muscle spasms? I've been getting somethig very similar in my right ear. It's been happening for the last maybe three of months. 
For maybe the first month I wrote it off as stress and lack of sleep, but now that it's carried on and I'm in much better health, I'm worried.

It occurred to me that this could be some sort of damage to the ear. Given that it's not triggered by excessive noise I'm not sure this would be the case and I don't hear any tinnitus like sounds so I'm honestly not sure. Figured I would ask some prod that take great care of their ears.
Thank you 

EDIT: I'm planning on seeing a doctor about it. I just wanted to check with people who knew their ears before I went to see if other people had experienced it or if it was definitely something to worry about.

[QUESTION] Long post asking for help with band rehearsal setup,"Sorry for the long post, but I have a lot to ask. I’m looking for guidelines, tips, etc. while I start down the road of improving my band’s rehearsal sound.

We are a group of middle-aged friends who recently started getting together weekly to rehearse rock songs, mostly grunge. Most of us played in bands in the past but stopped due to kids/work. We’re all back into it and are looking to improve as musicians who might occasionally play out. But for now, it’s just for fun.

We share a 15’ x 20’ rehearsal space with other bands, [which looks like this](https://imgur.com/a/7KrpoNO).

I have amateur experience with home recording and have done live sound a few times, but I’m very green. I think I have OK ears and am a bit of an audiophile, and I usually pay attention to a mix even when casually listening to music.

Setup:

1.	Mixer – Allen &amp; Heath Qu-16
2.	Two wedge floor monitors. Forget the brand, but they’re 15” with horns and sound OK.
3.	Monitors are used for vocals, guitars (one direct from modeler, other mic’ed from small amp), and keys (direct stereo).
4.	Bass plays straight through large bass amp
5.	Drums are not mic’ed.

What works:

1.	The space is comfortable, with carpet and acoustic treatment on the walls. Ceilings are high, 10’ or so.
2.	Drum riser is good, gives us nice face-to-face visibility
3.	Awesome mixer, decent monitors
4.	We religiously record and review each rehearsal to hear what’s going on. I’ll post some samples after we get some obvious things dialed in – not worth listening to right now.
5.	Bandmates are cool, we’re all in this for fun, we’re all old, and so no ego stuff happening. I mention this because they’ll be more open to experimenting, vs. having a hotshot guitar player who needs to be max volume all the time.

What doesn’t work:

1.	Wish we could get rid of some of the furniture and spread out more, but it’s not our space
2.	We usually play way too loudly, and it’s one of those things where we start out loud and get super loud by the end. I took a measurement one day with a proper meter and we were close to 110dB room volume. And that wasn’t our loudest.
3.	I play guitar and usually can’t hear myself, even though I’m right in front of the monitor. This is apparent in our recordings too. In fact, over the two months that we’ve been together, we’ll cycle between bass too loud, drums too loud, keys too loud, etc.

Setup questions:

1.	Should we mic the kick drum? And if so, is a fancy drum mic necessary or can we use an old SM57/58 for now?
2.	Should we run the bass direct? And if so, do we need a DI box or can we plug straight into the board? Reasons for not doing this is fatiguing the monitors, and also the bass amp sounds cool and very full through the amp ;)
3.	Floor wedges are angled toward the center. Given our small space, should we aim these straight back so those of us who stand off-axis can hear more?
4.	Any tips for reducing room volume? And what is an ideal room volume anyway? Tough conversation to have as everyone wants to use the time to rock out and let off steam. But when we play so loudly it’s impossible to hear each other and everything is a mush of sound. Plus not at all good for our ears (we wear plugs, but still).

Mix building:

1.	What are the standard “do this every time”  or ""never do this"" things? E.g. don't turn yourself up without checking with others, because maybe the rest can turn down.
2.	From other replies, it sounds like I should start with the drums, then bring bass to similar volume, then guitars, then keys, finally vocals.
3.	Is it correct that when setting levels that everyone play at max patch volume, and then only dial back for quiet parts of a song? Right now I think the bass player backs off his volume knob (yes, I know it’s really a gain knob) for sound check and then ups it later on for “boost”, which is probably never dialed back. I suspect keys are doing the same. I set all my levels (clean, dirty) the same and then sound check with my normal dirty patch. I have a special boost patch a few dB higher just for leads. Other guitar player has clean patches quieter than dirty ones. What kind of ground rules should we have here?
4.	Right now I (stupidly) have everyone play/sing an E chord and try to quickly dial in levels in 20 seconds. I know this is wrong, but what’s better? Should we always start with the same song and have me adjust as we go through it? Or start layering on top of the E chord one-by-one?
5.	I currently pan my guitar a little more toward me and the other guitar more toward him, just so we hear a little more of ourselves. Is this normal/OK to do?
6.	Given our setup, is it safe to assume that everyone should be able to hear everyone somewhat clearly if we get room volume and mix set correctly? Or will it always be the case where the drummer can’t hear the keys, for example?
7.	How much should I be tweaking while we rehearse? I want to focus on the songs way more than the mix, so don’t want to be distracted/distracting by constantly fiddling. But I think it needs to be more than the total of 60 seconds that I’m giving it now.
8.	I’m assuming that if we work on getting our rehearsal mix dialed in better, then it becomes much easier for us to transition to a gig setup if we choose to play out. Is this fair?

Thanks. I know this is a lot, but any help is appreciated. I’ll post more specifically (and succinctly) as I start working through this.

Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, please direct me if you think of somewhere better to ask this.  


I've had this idea in my head for probably 10 years. I want a speaker that can produce high quality sound but only to the intended recipient. For example, I am sitting at my desk at work and want to listen to music. I want to hear it, but I don't want to disrupt the rest of the office. I also don't want to wear headphones in case I need to hear something around me.

&amp;#x200B;

[This image](https://imgur.com/DvV2jNV) is my idea. A small speaker that has 2 speakers. Speaker 'A' is sending out the music you are listening to, and Speaker 'B' is sending out frequencies that are 180 degrees out of phase from the music that would somehow ""collide"" with music 'A' at a set disctance so that outside the radius the music is dead.

Room/SPL measurement help,"Hi all,

I am a HiFi enthusiast, and would appreciate your help. I have set up an alright near-field music setup with Genelec G3, Benchmark DAC2 HGC and plenty of acoustic treatment (Konto panels and DIY bass traps). However, I don't have a way to take objective measurements of sound levels and room response. I want to make sure I don't damage my ears with too loud music and want to also get objective data on my room's response.

I am located in Finland, so Thomann's selection is available for me. Budget target is around 100€, but I can stretch to 200€ if it is necessary 

I don't have any microphone or mic preamp. I need to get the signal from the mic to my PC, so and USB mic or mic/usb-preamp combo would be the way (I think).

I won't be using the microphone for other purposes than measurement. From what I know, I think the mic should have a flat response and an omnidirectional pattern.

1) Is there a microphone that would do both: reliable SPL and room response measurement? Or would it be better to purchase separate devices?

2) Depending on the answer to question 1, do you have recommendations for the devices?

"When do you pick plate vs hall, etc?","I'd think this would be a common topic but I just searched up plate on the subreddit and didn't see a bunch of posts about this topic.

I have been using Soundtoys Little Plate recently as a send with decay at minimum (500 Ms)lady anding Si Q to boost the send highs by 15 dB (Little Plate is extremely dark). Most sounds get 5-10% wet.

I'm pretty happy with what I'm getting with Little Plate. I'm also renting to own Toraverb but I have a hard time figuring out which would be best. The two are completely different (plate vs computational) but the difference isn't as apparent as the difference between any other effects I use (chorus, EQ, flanger, phaser, distortion, etc).

Are there situations in which you would instantly realize you need a hall instead of a chamber, plate instead of hall, etc? Or when you would decide you need multiple?

I like the sound of dry stuff and plates seem more forgiving because I can get low decay times (this I why I don't currently use chamber for example). Little plate is snappy enough on drums but I don't find myself wanting to use something less snappy on a vocal for example. Even on a pad which is AFAIK the most naturally reverby sound. Would you naturally increase the decay time you use for a pad or other non transient sound using a second send?

My Guitar Tracks Sound Like Garbage,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started getting into home recording mostly just to record my own ideas and try to get a decent mix in the end that I can show my buddies or put on youtube.  The issue is that everything I record kind of sounds like garbage.... Its just full of low end and lacks brightness and that chimey tone. The thing that bothers me the most is when I watch a Youtube clip of someone demoing the same amp / sim / IR's as me it sounds totally different and this is with no EQ or Compression etc... Even the DI tracks they record just sound better but I can only imagine this is a hardware issue on my end.

&amp;#x200B;

My equipment is a Steinberg UR22 for an interface and I use Studio One as my DAW. I either plug my guitar into my 6505 tube head which is plugged into my Two-Notes Torpedo live into channel 2 of the UR22 or I try and just go straight into the channel 2 with the instrument level button pushed on and use either Helix Native, Bias Amp, S-gear 2 etc with quality IR's ( Ownhammer or Celestion ). My guitar is a Ibanez JBM100 I think? Its the cheaper Jake Bowen signature guitar.

&amp;#x200B;

Is my UR22 not cutting it for this application? Am I overloading the pre? ( I do see some clipping and the gain is at the lowest ). Is there something I can do to fix that?  If I was to buy a different interface what would you recommend? I am really looking at doing almost anything at this point and I feel like I have good hardware maybe minus the UR22 since its low end",t2_f6ym47s,1,0

Load box for IR's question...,"Starting to jump in to the world of IR's...I'm scared. Always mic'd up amps but to more I read and see, I'm coming round to the convenience for sure. 

I bought a Bugera PS1 hoping to kill two bids with one stone, firstly to be able to use my amp at low volumes and secondly to use it as a load box and try this IR business. 

Well either my amp doesn't wanna play ball or the PS1 is not that great as an attenuator...it sounded TERRIBLE very fizzy, made me hate my amp (Cornell 20w Plexi). I tried using it as a load box but didn't really get anywhere, I think the attenuator was still getting in the way as the manual says when using the power soak you will instantly be hearing your amp at 50% so basically I was trying to get a signal into Logic in with an IR on half the sound/volume my amp should be pushing out. 

So now I'm looking at dedicated load boxes, maybe something like the Suhr Reactive Loadbox which I believe will just send the same amp signal through to my interface. But here is my question...

Since I have a Plexi style amp, theres no master volume so to get my overdrive I need to crank my amp (hence my attenuator experiment at the beginning)...so if I was to use a dedicated LB, where will I essentially be able to get my extra gain? Bringing Master faders in Logic down while turning the amp up? 

Apologies if this is such a straight forward thing, I've just done so much research and YouTube'ing I'm not really making any sense of it anymore.

Crosstalk in my patchbay is driving me crazy,"So I recently bought a Behringer patchbay, definitely not top of the line but I thought it would get the job done.

Thoughts on metalcore production?,"Other than a few albums by August Burns Red or Katatonia  (and they hardly fall under the ""core"" label), most albums in the genre don't *sound* spectacular. There's no depth, no substance, no *balls*, nothing that makes me foam over their studio gear. Older recordings, like ""Back In Black"" or the ""Cheers"" theme have something magical about them, you all know what I mean, and that should be easy to carry over to metal, but no one seems to be doing that.

I'm thinking years of low budgets and lo-fi recordings have done something to the culture just like what happened to punk and black metal way back when, but ""American Idiot"" by Green Day and ""Everyone, Everything, Everything Ends"" by Shining suggest even the most dedicated DIY scenes can value quality. And I'm just not hearing that from core bands.

My band just started pre-production on our second album.  Our producer's into all the big core acts and as I hear their records, as I watch him quantize/pitch adjust all the guitar and vocal parts and layer them with some digital misinterpretation of ADT, as I hear people go ""huh?"" at the word Neve, I fear we're not gonna be challenging ourselves to get something spectacular.",t2_wobc5,4,0
Comparing insulation types for Bass Traps,"Who here has built there own absorber panels and/or bass traps? I'm working on some DIY acoustic treatment; looking at Roxul to make my absorbers.

Obviously soundproofing and acoustic treatment are not the same thing, but I'm still curious to see if anyone has compared the two, especially for corner bass traps.

For those who have purchased commercial absorbers / bass traps, how are they constructed? I know most use fiberglass (gross) but it would interesting to see the differences between panels and how the construction affects performance.

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan for wall panels is to make a frame out of 1x4s, put a 2"" thick piece of mineral wool in there, and leave a 2"" air gap in the back.

I am aware that at the end of the day, the advice is always ""it's right if it sounds good"" but I was wondering if folks have personal opinions on how you approach this question, or if there are good online discussions on this topic.

I guess a related question is ""How many of the vocals that I hear on the radio that sound like a single track actually have additional sound incorporated from additional takes?""",t2_1r3g,8,0

Comparing Santana (1969) to Abbey Road and Pink Floyd work during that time.....,"I was listening to Santanas debut album and realized how GREAT it sounds for the time (By great I mean, well balanced, perfect clarity/detail on every instrument). Then I started wondering why it sounds so much better than Abbey Road (which honestly sounds great) and Pink Floyds' stuff at the time. Recording/mixing for Abbey Road was amazing in my opinion but clearly not as defined/detailed sonically. Is there something I'm missing here?",t2_fogue,30,0

Recording line-level with a Berhinger UMC204HD ? (Silent Brass),"Let me preface this with an apology for my very amateurish questions!

I currently have a Berhinger UMC204HD audio interface, which has 2 XLR/TS combo inputs. When connecting a microphone via XLR, the ""Line / Inst"" toggle switch doesn't apply, but if I connect via 1/4"" TR it does apply.

&gt;**From the manual:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**LINE / INST** (UMC202HD / UMC204HD / UMC404HD) selector designates line level or instrument level input source at combination XLR / ¼"" connector(s).

Now, my confusion comes from the labelling of this switch: ""Line / Inst"", which I thought was Line-level and Instrument-level, but now I think it is referring to something else OR my understanding that headphone output was line level is not correct!

If I connect a TRS lead from the headphone output of my Silent Brass system to to the TS input of a combo, the levels are extremely low while set to ""Line"", and are higher when set to ""Inst"", but still too low to be useful. Poor signal to noise. (Pad switch not pressed).

*(FYI Silent Brass is a trumpet mute with built in pic up microphone, and a little box which remodels the sound so that my trumpet sounds real and loud through my headphones, but neighbours can't hear me).*

Connecting the microphone from the mute directly to the interface results in no sound. It needs the little magic box to be able to hear anything at all.

So, some questions:

1. Is a headphone output considered to be Line-Level?
2. Is the ""Line / Instr"" switch meaning ""Microphone / Instrument (guitar)"", and not actually meant for Line-Level?
3. The headphone output is stereo. Is it bad to connect it to a single input, even though there is only one microphone in the mute?
4. Is there any other way I can use what I have to record from the Silent Brass?
5. Am I just way off the mark here?

Thanks!",t2_kakix,0,0
Quick question about recording in stereo vs. mono,"Forgive my noob question, I am pretty new to this game. So I have a couple of synthesizers that I want to record as stereo  (to capture panning effects, etc.) using a scarlett 2i2 and ableton. I bought a couple of these [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SMMMH4/ref=oh\_aui\_detailpage\_o04\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SMMMH4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

thinking it was what I needed, but now I think I was wrong. I plugged the two ends into the left and right output of my synth and the single end into one of the front inputs on the 2i2, but sound was super quiet. Do I actually need to use two separate standard 1/4 inch cables, and use both inputs on the 2i2 in order to record one instrument in stereo? If that's the case, is there any way for me to record multiple instruments at once in stereo, without buying a better interface?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, related question... is there any advantage to recording in stereo if I am not using panning effects? Like will I be able to get a fuller sound or something like that? Thanks!",t2_dfky2,6,0
Advice with using a mic in a small room with terrible acoustics...,"Ok so, I'm a broke college student who can't afford $100 of acoustic treatment, plus my room doesn't really work space wise...

Anyways, my biggest problem right now is recording, my small room has terrible acoustics. When recording vocals I try to use my closet, it's not a walk in but it has clothes in it so I try to use them as a sound absorber. So my basic question is should I set it up so that I'm in between my clothes and mic or should I set it up so that the mic is between me and my clothes? I'm using a mic with a cardioid pattern, so would it be better to sing towards the clothes as a sound absorber, leaving the mic to pick up my room acoustic, or should I put them behind me so that the mic blocks the room acoustics and the clothes prevent any reflection back to the mic?

I think that the best would be to sing at the sound absorber, so that the most of the sound is killed right there. But it seems more logical to use the cardioid pattern (which I know doesn't work perfectly) to block the room acoustics and the sound absorber to prevent reflections coming back. So honestly I don't know, I'm not an expert and that's why I'm asking!

EDM Background,"So I've spent the better part of the last 8 years creating electronic music tracks start to finish. From sound design to final masters. However, having a musical background and instrument proficiency, amongst other reasons is why I'm starting to dip deeper into actual production and audio recording aside from fully synthetic projects. 

So my question is how much, if any knowledge I have about mixing and mastering electronic tracks can/should be brought over into the analogue world. 

I'm not ignorant to the fact that edm tracks inherently want to be crushed harder i.e -3 RMS whereas conventional tracks are more transparent. I'm more interested in the sound processing aspect. I.e learning if knowing that many instruments root freqs sit around 500hz, or that 4khz is the freq most senstitive to ears according to the fletcher munson curve, or using a 4:1 ratio for vocal compression, or to mono sub freqs; holds any value in audio recordings or to leave them at the door. 

Ive been watching URM academy, SpectreSoundStudios, and a little RecordingRevolution to also aid in this transition. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.",t2_x0mr05j,4,0

The film Bohemian Rhapsody has quite a bit of vintage gear on close ups.,"I just came out from watching [Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27zlBpzdOZg) and when in the opening sequence they highlight the [Shure 565SD](https://imgur.com/fKFxA6L) Freddie sang with during Live Aid, I knew the geeky tech aspect of things was going to be well covered.

And so it was. Of course the movie never really stops to delve into the recording too much, but it has enough of it. A great little montage showing the recording of their first album, and some longer sequences recounting the recording of Bohemian Rhapsody. In both of these (and in some other parts of the movie scattered around), there is plenty of quick close-ups to tape machines and analog consoles.

There is also a nice sequence where Queen is rehearsing for the Live Aid concert, shot at the real [Air Studios \( Lyndhurst Hall\)](http://www.airstudios.com/the-studios/lyndhurst-hall/).

Custom foam for mic rack drawer?,"I'm in Pick 'n Pluck hell for the moment with a new remote recording setup.  I'm trying to make everything as compact as possible, and I have a lot of mics I'd like to stuff in a 2U rack drawer.

Here's what it looks like currently:

https://imgur.com/a/22lRlSX

Unfortunately, standard pick 'n pluck foam ends up wasting a ton of space, I'm discovering.  Almost all of my mics end up wasting an extra row of foam in order to sit snug enough to not move.  

I think I'm going to have some custom foam made to perfectly fit everything.  Beside being able to specify the exact dimensions of the cutouts, I also would like to break up the drawer into two stacking trays, and put my more commonly used equipment on top, and less common on bottom.  Haven't figured out how to arrange all the mic clips and windscreens yet, though, so any suggestions are appreciated!

Does anyone have recommendations on where to have custom foam made?  I've never had to do this before, so I'm not sure where to start or how much it costs.  Do I need to provide a CAD drawing of everything to cut?  Is there somewhere I can download the detailed dimensions of common mics, or should I just trace the foam from the original mic cases?  

Is there a variety of foam material that is best for this application?  I notice that some high end mics come quite overprotected with a big case full of soft, very squishy foam, whereas some other high end mics come in compact cases with very dense foam.  I'm inclined to go with the denser foam, so that I can be more space efficient, but I want to make sure I understand the tradeoffs.  I also know I've had issues in the past with certain types of foam inserts disintegrating over time and getting foam dust everywhere.  I'd like to avoid that, so I hope it's the case that today's materials simply hold up better.

Gain staging,"One thing i want to clarify is gain-staging because i want to clearly understand it.

So , basically , to do a proper gainstaging , i put a mvmeter plugin at the begin of the plugin-chain of every track . The mvmeter plugin has a gain-knob which i set it to bring the signal near 0VU(-18rms).  

And , if needed , another gain unit at the final of the plugin-chain for fine-adjusting the faders if the final signal is too high . (I drag it down with the gain unit) . 
The RMS value at the end of the effects-chain(compression,saturation,reverb...) is above 0VU . Is that ok?

Creating a line driver for DJ equipment.,"So this is a little off the beaten path, but I'm trying to figure out the right way to handle this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple of DJ gigs coming up. Rather than use house systems (too much left to chance), I've been using an \[AKAI AMX Serato controller\]([https://serato.com/dj/hardware/akai-amx](https://serato.com/dj/hardware/akai-amx)) hooked directly to my laptop via USB (so the MBP/software handles all actual audio duties and then sends the composite signal back out of the interface). 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, as it's USB powered (no ability to use external power), the -10db RCA outputs are very weak and require gaining things way up on the house DJ mixer (or redlining the crap out of the interface itself - both are bad, obviously). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I need to create or modify an active line driver to goose the output levels of this contraption. One thing I was considering was grabbing a car audio line booster like \[this Cerwin Vega\]([https://www.amazon.com/CERWIN-IOEMHL-2-Channel-Output-Converter/dp/B00P25VU84/ref=sr\_1\_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541169732&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=audio+line+driver](https://www.amazon.com/CERWIN-IOEMHL-2-Channel-Output-Converter/dp/B00P25VU84/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541169732&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=audio+line+driver)) that would let me introduce an active gain stage to get maybe 6-10db more before it hits the house mixer line in. But this is a car audio product and has that 4-pin harness with one of the pins for a 12v power source. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just buy the thing, cut the red wire and run to a wall-wart? Can I even do that? I know my fair share about DIY builds in the studio, but car audio is an alien world to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Failing that, can anyone think of another solution without too much time or investment. TL;DR: Need to get 10db more gain from an RCA output. Thoughts?",t2_13vi5c,3,0

EQing my monitors to solve room problems?,"*Posted this over at the Reaper Blog forum on FB but just wanted to post it again here to get everyone's advice.*

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been trying to set up my room properly acoustic wise and I've moved my desk like 3 times over the past week trying to work out the best solution for my spot. I found a good spot but my room is an odd shape so it's obviously not perfect (is it ever though?).

 So, I did this thing where you set up a microphone at your listening point (where my head is in the equilateral triangle) and recorded pink noise to get a readout of where your room is at sonically. I analyzed the recording of the pink noise using Voxengo's SPAN. *(The mic was a sterling st55, obviously I know the mic should be 100% omni but I'm just working with what I have to try and improve my situation somewhat)*

 I then used three instances of an EQ to really match my room's recording of the pink noise to the regular pink noise generated by a Pink Noise plugin.

I also set the automatic gain compensation on the EQ's to make sure there was no increase in volume level from the  EQ's. I triple checked this using a test tone and there is no volume change with and without the EQ's.

The result seems to be awesome.  I saved these three EQ's as an FX chain called 'Room Compensation' and it really seems to help. Things sound a little bit ""better"" now. I also listened to some reference songs I have and they sound great so I'm thinking that this is a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

However..

I googled this and found an article saying that this was not a good thing to do; I don't understand why though. The EQ is compensating for the inadequacies in the room right? The general consensus from I've read on other forum posts and articles is that doing this can help solve frequency issues within a room but not problems that are 'time-based' like standing waves. I've seen so many responses on similar threads like ""yea, don't do that"" and ""that's dumb hahah"" without giving much reason but it seems to make sense to me.

Obviously this isn't a perfect solution and I am currently figuring out an acoustic treatment solution but to me it seems like, okay, the room is causing for example, a dip/rise at this frequency, so lets boost/cut it there to make it sound as it actually should. Makes sense..right????

Has anyone ever done this? Am I an idiot? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Kick pedal squeaks are making me feel homicidal. HELP!,"I'm stuck in a weird situation and I need some guidance, if possible.

Swapping springs didn't seem to make a difference. I don't have any sort of hardware or real-time non-latent software that can do gating, so I have no way to get rid of the squeak aside from EQ. At least *none that I know of.* That's where you folks come in...

WHAT THE HELL CAN I DO?!

EDIT: It's like this Led Zeppelin song.  Hear the squeaks?

Audio Engineer vs A/V Technician,"I've recently been committing myself to the idea of going to school to pursue a career as an audio engineer, but was recently introduced to the idea of becoming an audio video technician instead.

Audio/guitar pedalboard power question,"Well I probably know the answer to this but I'll ask anyway...I've got a little Bluetooth receiver, like the kind people use to plug into the aux jack of their car and stream music off their phone. It has a teeny battery inside, and charges via microUSB. I've managed to find a female 9V (ie. the kind a guitar pedal would have) to microUSB adapter, with the theory that I could power this little guy off my existing 9V guitar pedal power supply, to run into a DI to stream music for between sets. (I realize there are lots of other ways to do this, but it's a very specific situation in which it would be easiest to do it this way if I can. Humour me.)

I assume the BT receiver wants 5V, as it's usually powered off a regular USB wall adapter...if I plug 9V into it, is this thing gonna heat up and be a problem, or is there a chance there's some kind of teensy weensy voltage regulator in there?

how to enable asio in matlab,"not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in, but

Im using Fireface UC audio interface.

    deviceReader = audioDeviceReader('Driver', 'ASIO', 'Device', 'ASIO Fireface USB', 'SamplesPerFrame', 1024, 'SampleRate', 48000);
    deviceWriter = audioDeviceWriter('Driver', 'ASIO', 'Device', 'ASIO Fireface USB', 'SampleRate', 48000, 'BufferSize', 128);

when I enable ASIO driver for both speaker and mic, for eg in the above code, there is no output sound. The buffer size settings obtained from  asiosettings(deviceWriter.Device) is set to 128 as well.

However when ASIO driver is not enabled, for eg in the following  code, there is real time output sound, but there is noticeable latency and a slight echo.

    setpref('dsp', 'portaudioHostApi', 3);
    deviceReader = audioDeviceReader('Device', 'Analog (1+2) (RME Fireface UC)', 'SamplesPerFrame', 1024, 'SampleRate', 48000);
    deviceWriter = audioDeviceWriter('Device', 'Analog (3+4) (RME Fireface UC)', 'SampleRate', 48000, 'BufferSize', 128);

Messed around and tried the following code, so it happens that if i set the mic to enable asio and speaker to enable WASAPI, latency is significantly reduced, but an echo still exists, after around 180ms from the original signal.

&amp;#x200B;

    setpref('dsp', 'portaudioHostApi', 3);

How do I successfully enable ASIO in order to reduce real time audio latency and have no echo effects???

One obvious thing that comes to mind for me is the lack of dynamic range. 

The drums have a flat kind of unconvincing ""paper tiger"" loudness (noisy but lacking in contrast). 

There's also what I would describe as a kind of ""springiness"" with guitars. With a lot of pop rock, you also hear this dense layering of trebly acoustic guitar over piano that is sort of a dead giveaway.

"Using guitar pedals, interface line/instrument impedance matching.","I work with sound as a video editor, but I enjoy recording guitar as a hobby. Let me lay out a simplified version of my setup first:

* Guitar into Fender Level Set Buffer (1Mohm in, 1Kohm out) -&gt; last pedal on board is an MXR Reverb with an output impedance of 100ohm, a pedal I have on almost full time.
* Interface is a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 2nd gen (no clipping issue on the inst input like gen one), 1Mohm on the instrument, 52kohm on line

The line mode sounds a touch more articulate with less bass with the instrument being the opposite; I don't dislike either setting and I suppose this is a ""use your ears"" situation but I'm curious on this sub's take on the matter. If signal level isn't a concern with either setting, should I have my interface in line mode or instrument mode if I have all this active buffering going on?

This sort of piggybacks the ""should I use instrument in on my interface or a DI?"" and I keep reading ""just use your interface, the difference is negligible unless you love the color of a certain DI"" so I assume omitting a DI box is a sane choice. And yeah, I'm aware of the benefits (transformer isolation, interface using a shunting resistor, etc etc etc).

Edit: and before we get too far down the rabbit hole, I'm less interested in more exotic stuff like Eleven Rack's ""True Z.""

Is it still possible to do these things simultaneously with low enough latency to not be noticeable?  Is it possible to do this without an interface as well?

I’m wondering if anyone has a good approach to using reverb. Too often I either get that harsh metallic sound from reverb, or barely a hint of reverb that doesn’t cut through the mix.

EQ matching and referencing at mastering stage,"I am currently pondering on the question 'where to apply the EQ matching technique (e.g. via Ozone 8 EQ matching; FF Pro Q2; MFreeformEqualizer) and using the classic reference technique to compare it to my own sound, while one is at the mastering stage?' Having said this, my aim is to reference the 'full' part of my song to a 'full' part of a reference mix.

My thoughts are that if you want to make use of EQ matching that it should be done AFTER the final limiter. On the one hand so, considering the fact that the compressor(s) and the limiter on my master chain can change the spectrum. Doing EQ matching or referencing a mix before the master compressor and master limiter could thus be a comparison between a reference mix and my own mix, which would not even be the final sound provided that the compressor and/or limiter would affect the spectrum. That would be comparing apples to oranges. A comparison AFTER the final limiter not.

On the other hand, finding out that my mix is too far off from the reference mix after applying one or both of these techniques AFTER the final limiter, could possibly make things rather complicated. For example, my EQ matcher could say that I lack between 800hz-1k. Where in the master chain should one fix this if one desires to follow the EQ matcher's 'advice'? If there is an EQ before the master compressor and you notch up 800hz-1k, it could lead to different reactions on the master compressor and limiter, and that would lead to having to set up one or both of those applications again. It is surely not the most practical way, but perhaps still a way which is worth to recommend?

And to go a little further into this subject, let's take it into the mixing stage: How should one apply the EQ matching technique and using the classic reference technique to compare for example a solo lead to my own solo lead, when we talking about processing in the LEAD bus, while still having an empty master chain?

Is the rush of blood/flexing in your ears a sign of too high a volume?,"I've always been curious about this. For example when wearing headphones and you suddenly mute the audio, I'll oftentimes get what sounds like a rush of blood, or perhaps something in/around my ear(s) flexing/shuddering.

It's much more apparent with headphones, but occurs when listening to monitors as well.

Need guidance for a sound installation,"Hi, 

first of all I should say that I nearly don't know anything about sound engineering but I'm an electronic music hobbyist really interested in these stuff.

The room is 3\*3\*2.5 meters and I wish to make a lively sound which fills the room and feels like a real natural ambience.

What kind of speakers do you purpose and in what directions should I put them?  
I'm on a budget, I have two Adam A5X monitoring speakers and I was thinking about renting another two but I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna have a stereo sound card which can't be used properly for a 4.1 or 4.0 system.

1. is there any way to make a natural sound space with only two speakers?

2. (if no.1 is a no) what are your thoughts about using 4 speakers with a stereo sound card?

3. are there other types of speakers which can work better for my purpose ?

Summing and gain staging multiple tracks in live setting,"Sound men, 

I am a producer/dj and I'm curious how I should be approaching gain staging with up to six tracks playing simultaneously during my live sets.

I break my songs down into their components including k,s,hh,bass,melody1,melody2 so that I can manipulate each track live and not just be pressing play and fading.

My first approach was to keep the mastering plugins intact when bouncing each track down which left me with hot, tinny mixes. Since then, I have not been mastering each group of stems and have been trying to recreate the mastering process live with multiband compressor, limiter etc. on my master in Ableton when performing.

I'm curious to hear if you all think this is a decent approach to get a quality live mix without sacrificing the live manipulation component or if I should be leaving most of the compression etc up to the sound man.

And ideally, how much headroom should I be leaving on my master in Ableton for the soundman to work with?

Thank you for any and all advice you might have! 🙏",t2_8m7cr,2,0
Quickest way to re-encode a lot of files from FLAC to another codec? Can a GPU be used?,"Hi,

Since I was a kid I've had an obsession with ripping CD's that my father had lying around and finding the highest quality audio I possibly could to keep. Over the years I've collected all kinds of music around 500GB in total now. Wanted to put music on a pendrive for the car but I couldn't since you know, FLAC and basic consumer electronics dont get along very well... Retrospect, probably not the best idea to keep it all in FLAC but too late now lmao...

So here's my question! Each file can be encoded with a single thread, yes? So with a R7 1700X I should be able to run 16 threads making this go pretty quick. But I thought of something, 16 threads is great and all but what if a GPU could be used, then those 16 cores would be turned into 4,096 cores with a Vega 64. I get that GPU cores are smaller less powerful cores compared to CPU intended to do smaller calculations, but how big is encoding as a job? Is there any software solution for this? 

At this point I'm just messing around, I'm off school for the week and thought I would peer into the mind of reddit and see what everyone thought and if I was crazy or not. I tried googling but I just end up with a lot of nonsense related to OBS and whatnot. 

On a more serious note, what codec should I use? Correct me if I am wrong; the king of quality audio seems to be WAV, the king of lossless compression seems to be FLAC, the king of efficiency at the sacrifice of compatibility seem to be Opus in OGG. But from sweet spot between compatibilty, quality and efficiency seems to be AAC. So do I encode everything using AAC? What software would you guys recommend for a big batch job such as this? On my honda it says ""Only AAC files recorded with iTunes are playable by this device"" can I spoof that?

**^tldr;** -Is GPU accelerated encoding a thing for audio?
                 -Is AAC the best ""All-arounder"" codec. 
                 -What does ""Only AAC files recorded with iTunes are playable by this device""

"If a four string bass guitar's low E frequency is ~41Hz, isn't HPFing bass guitars at 40Hz a good idea?","This question is inspired by a Thumpinator pedal I've discovered recently: [http://sfxsound.com/microthumpinator/](http://sfxsound.com/microthumpinator/)

I've checked some other reviews and mostly they highlight how the low B (\~31Hz) sounds less muddy. The thumpinator is just a HPF with a cutoff frequency around 29Hz as I understood.

When playing bass fingerstyle there's additional low frequency content that gets through to the speakers from the fingers hitting the string, and it may muddy up the harmonic content in the lowest range.

So I've been thinking, if you play a standard bass, wouldn't you get this benefit from cutting off everything below the low E frequency? There's no harmonic content we lose, but there's always a possibility of some noise being down there, especially when playing live.",t2_gfr6z,10,0

Advice on Sound Ordinance Issues,"Hello all,

I play in a rock band in my backyard. We play in an old elevated trailer that has plywood walls and a couple windows. One of the windows has an ac unit in it so that the jam room does not get too hot. We set up a little area in the room to record rough demos and put up some light sound treatment that mostly just deals with high frequency diffusion. A couple bass traps were also put up in the corners to help with low end. I should say now that the room is in no way treated perfectly but I do not plan on making it perfect because I am only renting the house and don't want to drop too much money into the room. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the issue. My next door neighbor is unfortunately an elderly woman who doesn't take kindly to rock music. Or any other music it seems. She has told me when we first moved in that we were too loud. So we turned down our volume. This happened again and we turned down even more. I even made a compromise with her that we would only jam once a week for two hours..which sucks for an active band that needs this for practice. Well today she told me that she is removing the ceiling tiles in her house and wants me to put them up in the jam room. Now I understand that they probably won't do much of anything and she is really just giving me her trash. I reluctantly agreed thinking this may cause a placebo effect for her and she will think that it is quieter than before. Anyways, she said that she was going to call the police if it continues to be too loud. I looked up sound ordinance laws and it looks like the dB limit from my property line must be below 65 which is ridiculous because a lawnmower is louder than that. I think that I maybe fucked here. If police come, it will most definitely be louder than 65dB. Even if we turn down or aren't playing I think it will still be ""too loud."" Do I have any options here? The spl meter on my phone that I downloaded reads at 70dB with just me talking.

Looking for a specific term for a sonic phenomenon,"As the title suggests, I cannot provide a sound example because I am not sure what to call the phenomenon I am imagining, but I will try and describe it as best I can.  What I am thinking of is an effect that is essentially a harmonic instrument / sound with a beating effect, as if the continuous tone were broken up into smooth but distinctly beating ""purring"" oscillations.  I am probably not thinking of phase beating because the sound stays very harmonic, I think what I am imaging is closer to a form of resonance but on a much slower timescale.  If anyone could identify the name or give an example of this kind of harmonic purring / beating / fast tremolo-ish sound effect I would greatly appreciate it!

edit: the best example I can find right now is from ""love to you"" by the Beatles linked below.  At the 58 second mark, a low sitar/drone-like sound enters panned mildly right. You can kind of make out the individual peaks of this ""growling"" sound, and I think the way the low fundamental causes the higher freqs to noticeably ""purr"" with it is the effect I am thinking of.

Plugins that do something different or special,"Searching online, you can find thousands of different recreations of compressors, EQs, reverbs, etc.  Some of them are modeled after hardware, some of them are combinations of basic effects, some have crazy modulation of parameters.  But they all boil down to the same essentials.

I'm looking for recommendations for plugins that have a unique function.  They solve a specific problem or create a novel effect.  Perhaps they've been copied since their original creation, but the idea is still special.

Here's a small list of stuff that I've found, although I really want to hear from others.

[Nugen Monofilter](https://nugenaudio.com/monofilter/)
This collapses whatever is below a set frequency to mono, but instead of cutting the side channel (like with a mid/side EQ) it attempts to match the phase between the left and right channels so that no information is lost.

[Melda MSpectralDynamics](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MSpectralDynamics)
I've only heard of spectral processing recently, but it seems to be a game changer.  Imagine a multiband compressor with thousands of bands.  This plugin seems to be preceded by the ProAudioDSP DSM in 2009, which was itself preceded by the Voxengo Soniformer in like 2003.  This Melda one seems to be the most configurable and have the most features, such as sidechaining, which allows it to perform the same function of another special plugin, [Wavesfactory's Trackspacer](https://www.wavesfactory.com/trackspacer/)
This allows you to duck only the shared frequencies between two tracks.
Spectral processing kinda leads down a rabbit hole, with something like [Unfiltered Audio's SpecOps](https://www.unfilteredaudio.com/collections/plug-ins/products/specops) at the bottom.  I have no idea what it's doing or why, but it creates sounds I've never heard before.

[Pretty much anything from Sound Radix](https://www.soundradix.com/)
These developers seem to be on another level.  Auto Align finds the most phase coherent delay between two tracks.  Drum Leveler is like a smart compander that can also be sidechained to use the transients of one track as an envelope for another. Pi is really special, it adjusts the phase of multiple tracks in real time to achieve the most coherent output signal possible.  Powair is a level-independent (!) compressor that can use K weighting.  Surfer EQ is an EQ where the bands are shifted in real time based on the pitch of a monophonic input.

[Oeksound Soothe](https://oeksound.com/plugins/soothe/)
This is another spectral processor, but it seems specially designed for a specific task.  It is designed to dynamically remove mid/high resonances without affecting the fundamental tones.  It's basically the ultimate deesser.  I've heard it take the strain out of a vocal, the buzz out of a synth, the ringing out of a guitar amp, the string noise out of a bass.

[TBProAudio ISOL8](https://tb-software.com/TBProAudio/ISOL8.html)
It's a free monitoring plugin with 5 adjustable band pass filters with solo and mute, and a mid/side section.  At first I didn't understand why it was necessary, and now I can't mix without it.

[UrsaDSP Lagrange](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/lagrange-by-ursa-dsp)
It's a free delay that uses granular synthesis.  You can read up on granular synthesis if you're unfamiliar, but suffice to say that is a completely unique delay that creates soundscapes out of nothing.

There are other unique ideas out there.  Steinberg has a multiband transient designer built in to Cubase.  Acon Digital has a chorus effect with a phase randomizer so that there's no comb filtering.  Variety of Sound has a transient-aware saturator that allows transients to come through cleanly.  Waves MaxxBass is a great example of a plugin with a special function, although it is so old that there are many other bass resynthesis plugins available now.

I'd love to keep adding to this list!  Please share anything you think might fit.

What is a good RMS and Max. Crest Factor in Electronic Music (House/Techno) ?," Hello !    

&amp;#x200B;

I know what a Max Crest Factor and RMS is, but I do not know what a good value for the music I make is.  I mainly produce (not mainstream) house music at 110-120 bpm and have this plug-in called ""span"" which shows me these two values.  I think the values ​​are influenced by genre &amp; quality of production.  But what is a desirable value for house music with a lot of organic / dynamic sound material (real drums, sax, xylophone, funky bass guitar, percussions)?  How high should the value be in a more synthetic housemusic track?  My productions usually reach values ​​of RMS 14 - 17 and MaxCrest 8-10.

I'm wondering about using my guitar pedals as FX from my DAW. I have a couple of spare slots in a 500 series rack, so am looking at the Radial EXTC 500 - However, quite a few of my guitar pedals are stereo, certainly the last few in the chain...

I assume the radial (or any re-amp box) is just changing signal on the way out from line level to instrument level / changing impedance to match what an amp or pedals are expecting?  

So if I want to get stereo back in, I could just use the HI-Z inputs on my apollo to re-record rather than needing two Radial EXTC's (they only have a mono send and return), unless I want to send stereo out in the first place?

Hope that all makes sense... Any input appreciated!

Guitar Effects," So I was wondering if anyone knows if it's possible to basically use a guitar pedal as an impulse response type thing and, I guess, ""sample"" it and then use it as a filter and separate effect during production? I have a multi effect guitar pedal, and I use amp Bias FX to record my guitar, but I obviously keep the DI guitar signal. However, when using the pedal, that goes straight in through my interface from the pedal itself, so the ""DI"" guitar signal is now coming directly from the pedal, meaning that it has an effect over it and is no longer a normal ""clean"" DI signal. I want to be able to ""sample"" the effect that's on the guitar somehow, so that I can record my guitar DI, but then still be able to use the effect that I want from my pedal. I know that I could just re-amp with the effect later, but I don't want to do that because sometimes playing with the effect on is what makes me play a riff or part of a song a certain way, so re-amping is something I want to avoid in this case. I'm not sure if this is possible, but anything would be appreciated. Links to any videos or any explanations... I'm also not wanting to have to dive too deep into the world of programming and DIY pluggins, so I would like to avoid all of that kind of stuff- Like I said, I just wanna be able to sort of ""sample"" the effect itself or the characteristic sound of it, and be able to apply it later as an effect like I would a reverb plugin or something. I use Reaper as my DAW if that helps or makes any difference in what my options are. Thanks! ",t2_1rhilfwu,1,0

Does Manhattan/parallel compression create a similar result to upward compression?,"I've been thinking about this.

Downward/standard compression: reduce the volume of anything over the threshold.

Upward compression: increase the volume of anything below the threshold.

Manhattan/parallel: Two tracks, one is compressed so that it is less dynamic. The other is uncompressed. So when combined, quieter moments will sound louder because of the presence of the compressed track. But louder moments will sound relatively unchanged because the compressed track is not adding as much volume, relatively speaking.

So the presence of the compressed track will act similarly to a ""minimum threshold"" in upward compression.

I understand that the mechanics work differently, but am I understanding that pragmatically they can be used in similar ways?",t2_5fqqn,0,0
Does anyone out there ever use multi-band compression with RMS detection instead of peak on the master?,"I want to get a denser sound out of my master.

Do you think the audio engineer will ultimately be replaced by algorithms and AI?,"As we move forward in the digital age I cant help but wonder if machine learning algorithms will become so advanced that people can get quality mixes without the need for an engineer. I know we have things such as LANDR which in my opinion don’t do a very good job.. but AI improves everyday, and I dont see why mixing couldnt be automated. I see mixing as a creative process that really comes down to taste rather than what’s right or wrong.. But I can also see a future which musicians, especially those with smaller budgets, can utilize a program that gives them a good basic mix. I’d love to hear others’ view on this.",t2_ak5vmiw,4,0

Using Two mics for vocals is the way to go!,"When the situation allows in studio I always use two mics of a lead vocal . One is often an SM -57 while the other can be a high quality large diaphragm mic. I notice I can eq the vocal to start by simply favoring the frequency of the mic that works best. Any two mics will work - but different mics are best compared to matched pairs. 

With rock bands I split the two tracks at about 10 and 2 o’clock. I put echo on one mic - usually the bright one . Then I mix without Eq. Using slight variation in pan - and I offset the time lines by a few 100ths of a second - more or less to taste - and it makes it thicker sound without being too loud in mix . Once I set the reverb I try to just leave it on the mic. Too much ? Then I pull the whole track down . 

So Once I do basic setup I mix with 4 parameters. The volume of each mic - and the pan . But I try not to off-set. The timeline too much . Just so I know it there . And you will find it interesting if you have the reverb mic channel hit before the dry one . 

Give it a try next time . It also works incredibly with solo instruments like a solo acoustic guitar. Try it. It may be just what the doctor ordered ! ? ",t2_8mrqz,93,0

Recording an Opera singer... for a rock song!,"TL; DR - I'm looking for guidance on recording a female opera singer. Particularly the kind of space I should record in, and the kind of mic to use - considering that it should fit with a grungy rock track.

&amp;#x200B;

There's an instrumental track on my latest project that just demands powerful female vocal performance. I've found a singer and as soon as I'm ready I'll book a session and get tracking.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that opera vocals can reach very high SPL. My instinct tells me to pick a nice big acoustic space, preferably well-treated, and to mic from more than a foot away to pick up some of that space. I could go for a church (because I might have cheap access to one). I'm sure the vocal recording itself would be ace, but I'm concerned that the church decay (or any large space) wouldn't match the 60 square meter room we recorded the band in. So should I go for close mic'ing in a small, dry/dead room instead?

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of mic choice, my instinct tells me to use my Stellar CM6 (tube-based, K67 style LDC) and probably have my Telefunken M81 closer as a backup. I also have an SE4400 (LDC) LRM-2 (ribbon), an AKG 451 (and other SDCs) and, of course, an SM57. What mics would you go for?

Help recording acoustic guitar in mono - scratching and sliding noises getting in the way,"I know scratching and sliding and finger-movement noises are very important in what makes real acoustic guitar sound so awesome and human.

"What exactly is ""pop"" mixing?","A lot of my clients keep mentioning they want a ""pop"" style mix. Even rock bands and folk bands, but especially rappers.

To me this means a brighter, more quantized ""perfection"" sort of tone within the mix. Usually consisting of a sparse but consice arrangement with not too much going on. Lots of simple catchy melodies with a ""pentatonic"" sort of vibe 

Big bright overly compressed in your face vocals, tight punchy ""small"" drums and tight, but huge low end. 

To me, I prefer rock bands to sound classic, that vintage sort of drum tone with a lot of room noise and reverb. The kick drum to be felt but not huge with low end and in your face. 

And a big vocal but with an organic sort of feel to the production.

 Think Fleetwood Mac or steely Dan. 

When someone mentions to me they want something to have pop mixing, my mind goes to these pre conceived notions, but I have a hard time applying them to music that was recorded analog with all real instruments. My brain just immediately hears that ""70s"" tapey vibe. 

Can anyone out there who works in pop explain to me how  to  go about mixing classically recorded instruments but with a modern ""pop"" sound in mind?

Mixing/producing varying amounts of guitars for indie-ish music?,"So my band is kind of post-rock influenced, if that helps. We're recording ourselves and for the most part we've had balanced guitar parts. We'll usually record two versions of each rhythm part..with different voicings, and hard pan them. And there's usually 2 lead-ish parts going on (but not really lead...more like just some arpeggios or little noodles here and there), which I've been panning less hard. So this way neither speaker is really fuller than the other, which..seems ideal? Is this the right way to go about this? And if there's one lead-ish part...should I still record the rhythm twice and hard pan it? I really like the trick of sending a reverb to the opposite speaker, so that helps some, but one part in particular of one of the songs feels weird and I was just hoping some people could share their thoughts/experiences and anything i should try or keep in mind. Is equal weight in each speaker really that important all the time?

Quick recording question: Waveforms and quantizing.,"Okay so say I have drummer Bob playing this AMAZING live track, but, during a part or two his kick drum or snare hit is 1/8th note off. IT's maddening listening to it because everything else sounds so perfect and good but this part. Or the same things happens with Jimmy's guitar solo: a couple notes are like 1/8th, 1/16th, 1/4th off, only a few of them are off the click track, but they are obvious.

I get quantizing with MIDI - you just drag around until the triggered audio lines up and sounds correctly. 

But, with these ""static"" audio tracks - I'm talking a complete recording from live musicians in audio waveforms, that aren't as easily editable: How is it done? Can someone step out the process for me? I see it like this:

Step 1) Cut the part that's off. 

Step 2) Now drag it to where it lines up on the grid. 

Step 3) Done! (Is it? Do I need to do anything else here? Like, now there's probably a gap or gaping hole in the audio waveform, which might skip or sound bad in the playback yes? So what to do?)

Someone else said you actually rarely cut and drag like this, but instead ""quantize"", like pressing a button. I know this is in pro tools, cubase, for MIDI, but is it also for waveforms? If you press that button doesn't it accidentally can possibly f^ck up some of the other notes track? Can you do it only on a single bar? ",t2_14dsl4,1,0

"Compression , saturation - loudness","Hello everyone , i want to permanently clarify something .

My aim for my mixes is somewhere -8 /-9 lufs (good for club play) 

To get there , i understood that i have to make a very balanced mix and a good mastering .

To reach a good loudness , i need COMPRESSION and SATURATION , right ?

Should i use compression and saturation on every track? 

The compression limits the peak of the sound and make it more liniar , right? 
The saturation increases the loudness without increasing the peak , right ? 

So , i should theoretically :

1.compress every track as long as it still sounds good .
2.saturate every track as long as it still sounds good. 

Extra: why should the kick be compressed ? It's a ""boom"" sound . It gets less punchier with compression . 
Should the sub bass (3xosc from fl studio) be compressed ? Or just saturated?

First Tracking Session,"Hello friends. 

So I am in search on some advice regarding tracking a full band session. I should preface with this:

First off, this will be my first time really “taking the board” and working with a band on a session. It should be said that I reached out to these dudes (one is a good friend), because I am trying to get better with the more technical side of music and recording music. We have all agreed that this will be a good growth opportunity for both parties and there won’t be any money exchanged and it will be a pretty casual day. 

That being said, I am trying to get some advice on things to watch out for and to be prepared for, as well as some pro tips on things like checking phase on drums, getting the best recordings possible with what I have to work with, and just silly avoidable mistakes that a rookie like me will probably still fall victim too. Any advice helps!

Also, as far as gear I will be running Logic Pro in my MacBook Pro and using a Zoom MRS 1608. I plan on mic’ing the room with my Bluebird condenser mic, using a SM 58 for vox, and the available drum and amp mics that they have to use. 

Thanks y’all!

Logic Pro - Parallel processing Latency Issues Resolved (sort of),"Hi there, I wanted to share with you a discovery I found while doing parallel processing in Logic Pro 8. (which I have a suspicion may still apply to Logic 9 and X).

Problem was that one of the main group busses was lagged by about 50ms or so than the rest of my main busses. (every channel was sent to one of 5 main group busses: 1) Drums,2) Instruments pumped with a sidechain, 3) Instruments I wanted no pump, 4) Bass and 5) ""wobble"" fx buss. All were outputting to output 1-2, except for wobble buss and reverb buss, which were both routed back to the instrument buss with sidechain, and this routing is exactly what was causing the problem.

I was able to test this by sending a snare hit to the buss in question, while simultaneously sending to one of the other busses (also tested with main out), and you would hear it slap twice. I was fearing that perhaps new york compression and other parallel processing techniques might encounter issues in Logic pro with latency issues due to some architectural 'error'. However, with a little experimentation, I was able to alleviate the problem. **The short short summary is that it seems logic may have issues with multiple auxes outputting to eachother, rather than when they all output directly to output 1-2.** 

\*Aux1: Instruments were sent to this buss for processing with an LFO to perform a 'wobble' filter effect (Serum FX) ---&gt; only send was to Aux2 for reverb, and outputted to Aux3 (main instrumentation ""pump"" buss). Serum FX had a side-chain input activated.

\*Aux2: Waves RVerb ---&gt;outputted to Aux3 (main Instrument ""pump"" buss). 

\*Aux3: Main instrument Buss with SSL buss compressor (sidechained to a kick drum captured from aux 20).

Aux 3 was lagging by the 50 or so ms compared to the other aux/buss groups. Latency was set to ""all"" in logic pro settings so in theory, compensation should have been all in alignment. But check this out: when I removed Aux1's reverb send, the latency disappeared. Likewise, when I changed the output from the reverb buss (aux2) from Aux 3 to output 1-2, the latency would also go away.  I should note, when I would remove all plugins from the reverb aux, this had no effect on latency (if still outputting to aux 3). So we might conclude that there was something about two separate aux channels (wobble buss and reverb buss) feeding into a common 3rd aux creating delay compensation issues with that particular aux channel. 

But theres more to the story: If I removed the sidechain from Serum FX on Aux1, the latency disappeared. it didn't matter what was going on with the reverb aux. So I thought maybe this was all due to a flaw with Serum. I removed Serum, added an ssl compressor to the same aux channel (aux1). Latency still gone, but then I added a sidechain to the compressor and guess what? latency back, and I could perform the same experiment above with the reverb channel. So there was something about having a sidechained aux and its send ultimately meeting at a final common aux that will cause it to experience faulty delay compensation. Remove either the Sidechain OR change the send routing, and the problem goes away. Weird right? Anyone want to chime in on what might be happening here? 

Interestingly, I have not been able to recreate this experiment all the time, it seems to happen at random. If I were to take a stab at what's going on here, I think it has something to do with how the busses/auxes are routed internally with logic when they are established initially, and how it relates to the delay compensation algorithm. Perhaps it depends on the order of when they are established, routed to eachother, or when the plugins are added...the list could go on and on. So I would suggest being aware that these problems may happen in Logic when auxes are being sent to other auxes and there is some sidechaning going on.

I can't hear the difference when mixing,"So I'm trying to mix some music I've been working on. I'm a musician, and I can say with confidence that I have pretty ""good"" musical ears. But man, I just don't hear most mixing stuff. For example, adding a bit of compression, or using different compressors with the same settings, adding a tiny bit of EQ, I just don't hear the difference. Of course if I compress something really hard or if I cut a lot of a freq. I hear a difference, but the small things I don't. For example, I bought some Waves plugins and everybody praises this J37 Tape Saturation, I just don't hear it doing anything haha.

Open circuit fault,"I’m working with an IP controlled amplifier made by QSC. Periodically I get an open circuit notification for one of the output audio channels. After a minute the notification goes away.

When this happens I still have audio on those speakers, and when I check the wiring on the amplifier it looks fine. I have not checked the speakers yet, will need a ladder to investigate. But what are your ideas why I would get an open circuit fault and still have audio?

UPDATE: Thanks for the ideas everyone. So far I have not been able to look further into the issue. But I have gone back to look at the amp a few times and the fault is no longer appearing. When it was showing up it would flash red, showing a fault, and then go away after 30 seconds. I will update when I get time to go back and look further at the amp, hopefully with some interesting information.

When did sound recording 'come of age'?,"Bit of a weird question; I'm hoping someone will be able to help! Apologies in advance if this is the wrong place to post.

It seems to me that audio recording took a huge leap forward in the 1960s. A great example of this would be The Beatles' output: 1963's *Please Please Me* sounds ancient, but move forward just five years to, say, *Sgt Pepper* and, to my ears, the recordings could almost have been made yesterday (in a pinch). Some recordings also seem to sound 'older' than some records which predate them. *Waterloo Sunset* by The Kinks and *A Whiter Shade of Pale* by Procol Harum sound particularly old to me, but were recording relatively late (1967 I think).

Anyway, apologies for the waffle, but what is it that distinguishes these 'old' sounding records from the ones which sound newer? Was there a significant advance in microphone technology or tape in this time? Was it just down to the mix or how the records were engineered? Thanks in advance!",t2_1zhryofh,79,0

Long story short, I need to record some impulse responses of exhaust systems. I ordered an electret microphone, but I have a dilemma about how to actually go about this.

1.  Just record a broadband impulse through the piping (smack something over the entrance, set off a firecracker)

2. Sweep a sin wave through it. I'm thinking I'll need to make a horn to couple it with a studio monitor, or just rig up some sort of woofer that I can seal to the pipe.

Recording to External HDD w/ MacBook Air (internal SSD) - do RPMs still matter?,"Hi guys,

I've been out of the game for a few years now, but recently installed ProTools 12 on my MacBook Air (2017 model, has internal SSD) and since my storage space is low, I'm looking into getting an external HDD to record to. My budget is pretty low - was hoping to spend ~$50-75 for 500gigs-1TB. I'm not planning to record dozens of tracks simultaneously or put loads of effects on them, for now - just some light home audio/midi recordings as I become re-acclimated with the software (planning to go back to school for my MFA next fall so I realize I may need to upgrade my gear around then).

Anyway, my question is this: do I need to spring for a 7200 RPM drive to write audio to, or would 5400 be adequate? I've heard external SDDs are ideal, but they are quite expensive, even for the lower tiers of storage space.

If anyone has suggestions on decent budget external HDDs that would meet my needs, feel free to let me know. I'm more curious about the importance of RPMs for recording when my internal drive is solid state.

Disappearing Width,"Hey guys,

Lately I've been really trying to learn to get my mixes wider, and in particular my electric guitar tracks. I recently started playing with a trick I learned online to just put a stereo delay on a mono guitar track (either a signal designated stereo delay plugin, or ya know, making a mono copy, hard panning both, and then delaying one with a sample delay). This sounded good! I mean in a mix it sounded cool, and I could go full blown width at like 180 degrees with plenty of room in the middle, or I can throw a directional mixer on and reign it in a bit towards like 70% max width on these delayed signals. Either way it was cool, and then I started feeding that into a nice stereo hall reverb - it sounded nice. But then just to check the mix, I put a directional mixer on the stereo output and made it all mono. The volume of this orignally mono guitar track dropped drastically, whereas other mono elements in the mix did not, which proportionally made them seem WAY louder and sort of ruined the whole balance. I understand this has to do with phase cancellation (right?) so I am dealing with this because it was  originally a mono source sound, so I have to heavily modify the hard panned or almost hard panned edits to get them not to be so similar to each other that  I get cancellation.   


\-I really would just like advice on dealing with this problem that I created, for instance how would you make those two signals 'different enough' so I don't lose them summed in mono? Is it pitch correction up and down a few cents each? Or longer delay between each (rn I have like a 10 ms and a 20 ms delay respectively)

\- But also, sort of going back to my original issue, what do you guys do to give a nice wide aspect to a guitar track? This problem came up because I am better at guitar than piano. I recorded a track that I wanted to have the rhythm changes and harmony carried by an electic guitar mostly. This is tricky because it seems so naturally mono to me. Whereas something like a synth or electric piano carrying the harmony and playing the chord progression, naturally lends itself to a nice wide stereo image...  Am I thinking about this all right? I always feel like I have a decent understanding of stereo signal paths until I think too hard about it, then my understanding seems to disappear and I start questioning myself (is this cancelling out? Is this two hard panned mono sources or a single stereo source from my Yamaha DX7 hardware synth ? Are Logic X's stock E. Piano sounds two hard panned monos or is there a middle portion to the 'image' of the sound and if so, if I put a M/S processor on there and suck out the sides, am I left with a combination of the two sides with a different time delay? etc etc. I just sort of think myself in circles and start to feel dumb, second guess myself)  


I'd really appreciate any insight that gets me closer to a confident understanding of how to add width to 'chord' or harmonic instrument tracks, and the ability to call upon this skillset when I need it, instead of just sort of guessing and checking with different combinations of delays and multi tracking.

Is it possible to retrieve mono information after applying FX to the side part of a stereo sound?,"I am an EDM producer with limited engineering abilities and this subreddit is full of engineering geniuses, hence my post.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I discovered that if I resample a stereo sound, separate the mid and side channels, and pitch the side channel, I get a really cool smeary sound. However, if I apply some FX, even if I collapse to mono, I can still hear some of the pitching. In other words, it seems that somehow my side information is obtaining mid information after using various plugins like chorus, flanger, phaser, and applying additional unison. This causes weird issues when I resample a second time.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question: is it possible to retrieve mono information after applying FX to the side part of a stereo sound? I am trying to keep the two separate for creative/sound design purposes. My intuition says that since all side information will normally be silenced when in mono, this should be impossible, but somehow I got mid information from the effects, I think.",no author,3,0

Audio Mythology,"Hi everyone.

I'm a big fan of the ""tribal"" aspects of audio - the road stories and the stuff that gets passed down verbally for years.

What I would like to know is this: **What was an audio-related belief that you carried for a long time before realizing it wasn't true?** For me it was that phantom power blows up ribbon mics. We've all been taught that it does, but it turns out not to be true, [despite having roots in a kernel of truth](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/study_hall/ask-jonah-addressing-a-long-standing-phantom-power-myth/). I personally never went for [speaker burn-in](https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/do-new-monitor-speakers-really-need-be-run-in) but a lot of people still believe it! A lot of misinformation out there as well about [sampling theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIQ9IXSUzuM) and array theory also. There's so much pseudoscience and nonsense in the ""audiophile"" circles (directional cables, and magic crystals, and the like) that I (and the professionals I know) just ignore it, but [loudspeaker isolation](http://ethanwiner.com/speaker_isolation.htm) does pop up from time to time.

These types of things are a topic of ongoing study and work for me. I'm interested in what other audio mythology is still out there floating around. Thanks for your time, everyone!

I [found](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/860794-REG/impact_me_106_6_end_jaw_vise.html) [this clamp](https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images500x500/impact_me_106_6_end_jaw_vise_1382469913000_860794.jpg) that is the perfect dimensions, but I think this kind of clamp is for gaffers and lighting grips, so it comes with a 5/8"" pin instead of a threaded mic clip mount, plus even if it was threaded it wouldn't be adjustable. I couldn't find any standard mic clip mounts that have a 6"" wide opening that could clamp to this. So maybe I'd have to get another clamp to clip to the vertical bar, something like [this one.](https://media.sweetwater.com/api/i/f-webp__q-82__ha-90ddb2c0e05e5c0e__hmac-4ab87dde3c9cc584eef7efbb619882595510d50b/images/closeup/750-MicStdExtBrkS_detail1.jpg)

I'm pretty sure the combination of the two would work, but it seems silly to buy two sets of clamps when there should be something out there that's better. What do you think?",t2_98ipb,11,0

Hanging Acoustic Panels From The Ceiling,"I'd like to hang a 24x48x4"" panel from the ceiling.

1 stereo power amplifier into 1 cabinet?,"Cabinet rated at 4 ohms, I'm trying to plug both sides of my stereo PA into the two inputs (yes, they are parallel inputs) of my cabinet.

The PA has been overheating to the point of shutting down (it has a safeguard that shuts it down before it gets destroyed).

My first thought was: I haven't cleaned it out ever so I should probably blow some dust out of there and clean the filters.

My most recent thought is: because I'm doubling the input to the cabinet does that mean the impedance rating has dropped to 2 ohms?

Tips for taming the bass guitar?,"I'm mixing an indie rock track for a friend of mine. A live recording with one Guitar, one bass guitar, electric keyboard, and drums. I used a AKG D112 on the bass cab and also tracked a DI signal.
I am curious if anyone had any tips or ideas they use in their own mixes to make the bass sit juuuust right. What I usually struggle with when mixing bass is the awful resonance that can pop up between 100-200hz.
I first will try EQ'ing the overbearing frequencies out, nothing too drastic. But usually I find that without them the bass loses all of its presence, in this song especially. The DI track is a bit shitty so I am relying on the D112 much more.

[Question] Will turning an external mixer on/off damage the inputs of my audio interface?,"Hi all!

I am running multiple synthesizers into an Allen &amp; Heath Zed14 mixer. I am then running both outputs from the Zed14 mixer into my Apollo Twin Duo audio interface. However, every time I turn the Zed on or off, there's a loud popping noise accompanied by a spike in the levels on the audio interface.

Graphical retuning after recording a live autotune session?,"If I record a session with autotune (auto mode, not graphical retuning) on and leave the recording wet (I know maybe not the best practice), can I still come in and slap a graphical retune like wavestune or Antares graphical mode on top to fix small errors? Or will this sound poor? I’m asking because I like the way that Antares autotune auto mode sounds, but I hate using the graph mode for the life of me and would rather use a different plugin (wavestune or melodyne) for post-recording adjustments. I guess what I could do is record the session dry but with autotune monitoring and then use wavestune or melodyne after to do all tuning, including the little adjustments. I just really like the way that Antares does the live retuning. I could also just use the graph software on the wet vocal to only touch up the parts that are problematic, and turn off the pitch blocks where I already like the sound.  Sorry if this is confusing...

"My utter frustration with the ""Produced by"" credit...","I've been working as a professional engineer/mixer/quazi-producer for over ten years. Mostly with local independent artists, some small label, and some major label artists.

Since the majority of my clients are rap/hip-hop artists, the proliferation of the misused ""producer"" title has really been driving me nuts. Yes, I've had the conversation MANY times with MANY of my artists, but I still feel like it's a conversation that needs to be re-had damn near ever session or every album release.

&amp;#x200B;

9 times out of 10 one of my clients come in with just lyrics and an instrumental. Either tracked out, or just the 2 track. I then proceed to go over the entire song before recording even starts. Song structure, melodies, arrangement, etc. They track their vocals, then sit on the couch while I completely rearrange the instrumental, add or remove instruments, create vocal melodies and harmonies out of thin air, and hand them a completed masterpiece in only a few hours.

I turn 4 minutes of a static unchanging 4 bar loop into a song with multipart arrangements that actually develops and breathes.

100,000 views

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously... What the fuck. I feel like it's a losing battle. No matter how many times I explain what a producer is, what an engineer is, what a songwriter is, and what a got dam beat maker is, if the meaning doesn't change in the popular lexicon, it doesn't matter. I never have this problem with my clients in other genres. And it really didn't bother me for a long time. I KNEW I made that song happen, and so did the artist. That's all that mattered. But as more and more people get credit for my work, people that my artist has never met, nor have I, and who never heard the song or had anything to do with the process, it starts to wear on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the diatribe.

&amp;#x200B;

TDLR: I'm tired of tracks that I created with a client, tracks that I spent my time and creativity on, having the credit go to someone who had zero to do with the track, simply because of the confusion and misuse of the term ""producer"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit: There seems to be a bit of confusion. Let's lay out an example:**

Artist comes in with lyrics for a hook, 2 verses, and a beat that consists of a 3 minute 4-bar drum loop (without the hi hats in the intro of course), a single bass line loop, and 1 lead synth.

&amp;#x200B;

I take that track, cut it up into pieces, add instruments, remove elements, and structure out a song with:

intro-1st verse - pre-chorus - chorus - 2nd verse - pre-chorus - chorus - bridge - chorus - chorus.

&amp;#x200B;

Artist goes into the booth, lays down whatever vocals they have written.

Comes out, we sit down and listen, talk about what will work, what would be a good idea, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Artist sits, I go to work. Tweaking vocals, pitching vocals, creating melodies, adding backing vocals, maybe even cutting certain bars that just don't work or re-arranging them. I create an 8-bar bridge out of preexisting vocals from other parts in the song. I usually create some sort of outro, and add extra elements in the last hook.

Then mix, master, finish.

Tips on Starting A Professional Recording Studio,"Hello, I have been recording out of my house for almost three years and want to go 'professional'. And before you ask, ""What does this moron mean by 'professional'"" Let me explain.   
I have always been into engineering. Ever since I got my hands on my first Tascam Ministudio cassette recorder; I have been fascinated. I used to try and record exactly what I heard on CD's and vinyl onto my cassette deck and attempt to make it sound equal and or better. Years passed, I played in a band and recorded our own music. That's when I decided I wanted to take the process of recording and chasing the ""perfect"" sound to the next level.  
I started recording out of my house and have slowly gained the reputation around my area for having the best sound, easiest to work with, and cheapest prices. This has gone on for a couple years, and now I want to achieve more. What I'm asking is; what are some tips or general guidelines, per-say, that I can follow that can help me better achieve my goals of being professional and making an honest living off of engineering? I know the basics such as marketing, being a people person, and how to get something to sound almost exactly how I wanted it to, but I want to know more of;  
\-How to secure a new recording spot (?)  
\-Is there an actual legality spectrum of recording that goes under the radar for the most part? (Loans, LLC's, Investors?)  
\-How can I maximize my reach to artists outside of my area (?)  
\-Basics fundamentals of a legitimate recording business  


I absolutely want engineering and recording to be my life career as it seems nobody can hear what I hear (Cocky, I know, but its something engineer's understand) and I want to pursue it as legally and as straight forward as I can.

I really have to say I prefer the dynamic mic for two reasons

2: Since I'm doing my vocals at home (I've also thought of renting a hotel room for this), I like that the dynamic is not as sensitive and I don't have to be as worried about reflections, ambient noises being picked up, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that typically condensers are used for studio recording, although I've heard of artists using dynamics in rare instances. Anyone here have any experience or suggestions for this recording method? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't have the budget to rent studio time and all that, as silly as it sounds, this is more of a personal album and I am obviously not expecting studio quality. Just good enough that I can share my tunes and see if they get any attention. If so I may invest in re-recording everything with better equipment in a more professional way.",t2_1qt96mro,2,0
Preset advice! Recording Album with UA Apollo Twin,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to take my home recording to the next level and I recently purchased a UA apollo twin Duo MKii and a new desktop Mac (using Logic). The album I want to pursue is going to be acoustic guitar, keyboard and vocals with other electronic effects added in from different presets on Logic. My question is:

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any recommendations on specific presets for acoustic guitar? I have been going through the stock ones and I am not a fan of any of them. I want a bit of a warmer/ambient feel than what I can find, and everytime I try to create my preset it is full of static. I do like the UAB-610B but other than that everything starts to get confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Signed,

Amount of signal loss when splitting a signal?,"I'm finding seemingly conflicting information all over on this one, I'm hoping someone can offer a definitive source.

Let's say you plus a dynamic microphone into a passive, Y signal splitter. How much of a decrease will there be in dB out of each output compared to the input?

Some people suggest it's 3dB as you're cutting the power in half.

Others suggest it's 6dB as you're cutting the voltage in half.

Others suggest it will be less than 1dB (more or less) due to the impedance in the circuit (the exact amount can be derived by using Ohm's Law)

Anyone have a solid answer to this?",t2_q098f,49,0

Can't seem to get a good DI bass sound,"I just bought a bass guitar to record some lines at home. I have no bass amp and I'm using the DI only (a Focusrite Scarlett Solo). I've used the Scarlett before with my guitars and even though it doesn't sound fantastic (big surprise), I've been able to get a nice, clean sound that has been easy to EQ and use plugins for.

Not with the bass, however. I've tried fiddling with the gain and the settings on the Scarlett, and I've tried EQ and compressor in my DAW, but that wont help if the signal is bad. It sounds terrible, with this strange digital distortion (even with low input gain), with the low notes too loud and the higher notes too quiet and they also have this wierd digital ""phaser"" sound to them. I don't know how to explain it.

Tips for having a balanced Vocal FX Chain for Broadcasting?,"Shure SM7B (and EV RE20) w/ a Triton Fethead and Audient iD14.

&amp;#x200B;

**#1 - Gate** \- I some have background noise (air conditioning).  I want the gate to be set so that it reduces background noise without making my breaths choppy.  How would I want to set the threshold and ratio to handle this?  Do I want a gradual slope under the threshold or keep the threshold conservative but cut off everything under it?

**#2 - Equalizer** \- Purely subtractive.  No additive EQ or coloration.  LPF starts around the 18k area.  Is that too high for any meaningful benefit?  With the HPF, I want to partially control harsh lows.  I want to still have some proximity effect, but not abuse it like some broadcasters do.   What effect would tapering down from 100 vs. cutting sharply at 40-50 have?

\#3 - **Limiter / Compressor / Multiband Compressor** \- I'm not exactly sure what combination of these I should have.  I would like more than one  so none of them need to be doing too much work.  Do I want the Limiter to hard-correct my voice only when it gets really loud or be done on a more gradual basis.  With the multiband compressor, I'd compress my the bulk of vocal range only so any background noise or sibilance wouldn't be unintentionally amplified.  For a male with a relatively average voice (not particularly high pitched or deep), what range would I be looking at?  200-1000 Hz?

First Live Sound Job - What to Expect?,"A friend of mine approached me yesterday, asking if I wouldn't mind the sound desk / mixing console for them for a bunch of upcoming shows at the start of next year.

A bit of background on the situation;

&gt; I have just started my second year as an Audio Engineer student at University (Previously worked as an IT Technician for years)

&gt;I have 0 experience setting up live sound (expect from within recording studios), however have been to a lot of gigs as a punter

&gt;My friends band are all experienced and professional musicians in a cover's band that mainly do rock and metal music (Velvet Revolver, RATM, The Killers).

&gt;He knows I am an amateur with no experience, but capable.

The band have offered to pay me and ""throw in some beers"", so this can be seen as a job offer, but for me it's more a good opportunity to begin my career within live sound, considering I have a good friendship with them already.

My question is; What are main ""tips"" and what to be expected on the day. I'm finding it hard to go in with a confident mindset when never having done it before, but I will never progress until I actually do it. I am more nervous about letting down my friends band.

Best way to route MIDI-enhanced VST through analog effects and back for recording?,"I'm running a korg Monologue that is connected into my DAW (FL12, but also could do Reaper or Tracktion 4) via USB for use as a MIDI controller. I have a plugin I'm using to emulate a synth, let's say FM8. 

Then I have two DACs available to me, a digidesign mbox 2 and a behringer xenyx Q502USB. I want to route the output from FM8 through an EHX cathedral stereo reverb and delay and then back into my computer for recording on a different track, post processed. Is there an easier way to do this? 

Ideally the cathedral will be mono in, stereo out (1/4""), into the xenyx rather than the mbox, because the xenyx has stereo in and is five channel (mbox is stereo if you use both available channels).

I need all the other channels open and free of effects processing for Volca beats and one for mic/guitar/PO-20.

I don't think both DACs can be in use at the same time, so I can't go from the output of the mbox into the the xenyx and be able to record on the latter. I can't pull audio from headphone jack with ASIO drivers pushing output to the DAC. 

FM8 can run as a standalone app. You think that would do it? What about other plugins that are made for use in a DAW? Do I just need a second computer?",t2_5jrjr,6,0

How can I tame an FM synth?,"Hey all. I play synths in a little experimental pop duo, and I'm a bit puzzled by FM synths. Whereas my analog and virtual analog synthesizers tend to be manageable when recording direct to a Tascam, my Volca FM has proven to be a high-frequency monster. I had to use a lot of EQ to tame the high-end, and even then, the tunes that rely on FM tend to stand out among the rest.

What strategies would you recommend? An equalizer prior to going into the Tascam? Filter it by processing it via one of my analog synths?",t2_1umnn1h,1,0
Recording Impulse Responses for Speaker Virtualization,"Speakers can be virtualized (simulated) with headphones very convincingly with impulse responses and convolution software. This however requires the impulse responses to be measured for the individual listener and headphones. I'm trying to achieve this.

I made impulse response recordings by playing sine sweep on left and right speaker separately and measuring it with two ear canal blocking microphones. I turned these sweep recordings into impulse responses with Voxengo deconvolver software. I also measured my headphones the same way and compensated their frequency response with an EQ by inverting the frequency response as heard by the same microphones. Impulse responses are quite good and certainly better than any other out of the box impulse response I have ever heard. However they are suffering a little by coarseness, sound signature is a bit bright and sound localization is a tad fuzzy.

When listening on headphones a music recording which was recorded with the mics in ears while playing the music on speakers the result is practically indistinguishable from actually listening to speakers. My impulse responses and convolution come close but still leaves me wanting for better. I think the main problem might be the noise introduced by my motherboard mic input.

I thought about using digital voice recorder like Zoom H1n for the job. This model can do overdub recordings with zero delay between the playback and recording making it possible even to record each speaker separately. I'm also assuming that the mic input on this thing is quite a bit better than my PCs motherboard.

Does is seem like sensible idea to use voice recorder and are there better options? Can you think of other sources of error than the noise from the mic input? Should I do some digital noise filtering on the sine sweep recording before running the deconvolution? Any other ideas for improving the impulse responses?",t2_42dngn,1,0

Looking for recording advice.,"Hi r/audioengineering! I am a shooter/editor that recently took a job with a national video-centric news organization.

I am aware I'm using it in mono, but that is fine. This setup plus the 'ableton setup' (see picture) allows me to use the AUX sends on my mackie with a 'reverb (e.g.) in Ableton.

I'm going deaf and I only have myself to blame,"I have never had great ears, I had surgery on my mastoids when I was in my early teens iand it worked to an extent to clear up the issues that I had previously.

As I went through my teens in the 90s, I was inspired by the regular grunge outfits of the era to start playing guitar. This lead on to me doing sound production at university, getting really into production and spending many long hours in the studio, either listening to monitors or headphones but using my ears for the most part of the day.

After uni I got a job for a year working live crew for a PA company. To start with this was just lugging equipment around, but soon got to setting up stages and then working the desk with the engineers. It was an awesome job and I loved it. 
I got to learn how to get sounds that took me hours to achieve in the studio, quickly, and to also learn how to mix and fix on the fly. 

After that year, I moved and although working a full time job, I got a gig at a local studio with a couple of producers that wrote for other people. There was a lot of just making drinks and keeping everyone happy but I learnt so much from those guys. 

One of the perks of the job was that there was a little mixing studio in the loft that I could use as my own. I spent hundreds of hours in that studio, as much as I could without dropping from sleep deprivation. I would often get back from work on a Friday, go straight to the studio and then go back home about 10pm Sunday to get ready for Monday (the studio had living quarters).

I got signed, I released music and I remixed and although I never made money from it, I always thought that I would never regret what I had done. I always viewed it as 'I may never get this opportunity again' so I pushed and pushed.

Now, here I am ten years later and most nights I cannot sleep from my tinnitus, it is a constant manifestation of pitch from which I rarely get any relief. 
My left ear has about 20% of the hearing it should have, my right has about 60% and the prospect of losing my hearing altogether in the next 10 years is very real. 

It turns out that I was an idiot. I knew my ears were not great. I knew I should not just keep turning the monitors up when I got fatigue and that listening to drums on headphones for 6 hours straight was a bad idea. But I did it anyway, because I was young, I had passion and I wanted to make it man. I knew the risks, threw them to the wind and now it is blowing back.

As a musician I'm happy with the following I've made and the opportunities I have, I've always wanted to try to make a career out of it, but now I'm wondering if it'd be better to move to a different field in music (mixing.) I've been balancing everything as a 'jack of all trades' type thing and know I need to settle down into one area to really get somewhere, just not 100% sure which one.

**TLDR;** I like making music and things have been going well except I think I like mixing more but switching fields is intimidating. ",t2_kqd1ow4,3,0

Can someone explain the poor digital sound quality of some hit rock albums? Do these sound better on vinyl?,"My specific examples are:

1.  Just about anything Bob Seger recorded mid-70's - early-80's.  I'll just use *Night Moves* (1976) as an example.

2.  Most of Queen's hit records seem to have the same problem.  I'll use the album version of *Bohemian Rhapsody* from *A Night at the Opera* (1975) as an example.

Forgive my lack of vocabulary.  But the best way I can explain what I mean is that the records I'm referring to sound flat and highly compressed.  I can even hear a ""hissing"" in these recordings.  ANY amplification seems to exacerbate the issue.  It's sad because this is music you want to play *loud*.  But you turn it up, and it's like it's behind a facade.

I own these albums on CD, I have quality lossless rips of them from other sources, and have heard them a million times on the radio.  Are they better on vinyl?  Did something happen in the transfer?

I've googled quite a bit to try to find commentary on this, but while I've found critics and fans echoing the problem of poor production, I haven't really found anything I would call an explanation as to *why*.  I appreciate any insights on this.

Playing sequential audio files so that they sound like one long track,"I have a script that I'm working on, where we are recording around 200 script lines, and 900 names. We are using the names as a part of the script, so that we say a sentence like ""here is the report for Steven"", which is a combination of an mp3 containing ""here is the report for"" and another mp3 containing ""Steven"", or any of the other names. In addition to this, we are also just playing files sequentially without names, so that we might have ""here is your report"" and then ""covering the time from January to March"".

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a pain in the ass to say the least. Because we are working with so many lines, we get fatigue from our voice actors, and invariably the lines all sound different. They are different volumes, different speeds, different intonation, and it is very obvious that these are separate recordings being Frankensteined together to produce the audio track.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is how is this solved by other people? Do you have to manually master each audio file, even when it might be combined with potentially thousands of other possible files? Do you avoid combining sentences like this? Do you record an entire script and then chop it up afterwards? I am an audio noob, and any advice would be greatly appreciated, about how you would go about the task of a single audio track being built from potentially thousands of audio files.",t2_12thjw,1,0

Anyone have experience using stereo bus compression on specific sections of songs?,"I was watching an old Pensado’s Place interview with Manny Marroquin and he spoke about using stereo bus compressors on certain parts in songs (bypassing them for the rest of the track) in order to achieve a certain feeling or intensity.

Can anyone help me out with this thought experiment involving the nature of reverb/acoustics?,"Although I'm a trained musician, I'm an amateur sound guy, so apologies if this is really obvious.

Whenever you take a sound and play it against its exact inversion, the result is silence, since one sound wave cancels each other out. My understanding is that this can be useful to illustrate things like what is lost when going between a wav or FLAC file to a lossy, compressed one.

**Thought experiment** - if I made two recordings, one right after the other, of some sound being played on a set of speakers in a hall, inverted one of them, and played them together, presumably they would not be exactly, sonically identical. But since every other possible variable is accounted for - same sound, same speakers in the same position, same mics in the same position, same hall at *nearly* the same moment, what would account for those differences? 

Is reverberation simply random, or is it approximately the same reflections every time, given similar conditions? How different will the ""initial"" state of the speakers and microphone (and possibly even the audio interface and computer) be from any given moment to another, and how could that affect the sound?",t2_pj41a,3,0

VCA Faders vs. Aux Channels - Help Me Understand,"I have been doing a ton of research on how to use VCA faders in my workflow. The benefits that they add make a ton of sense for dealing with automation and other volume elements.

My biggest question is this (please bear with me as I attempt to phrase my question properly):

I typically run all of my drums into an Aux Channel for processing as a group (Comps, saturation, mild eq, reverb etc.). If I create a VCA Fader for all of the drum channels and perform automation it will pull the individual drum faders up and down which would then be affecting the global output of the drum tracks to the Aux Channel. This would then mess with my Compressor Thresholds and such. Are my thoughts about VCA Faders incorrect and is there a better way to be using them?

*EDIT*
Thank you everyone for your amazing responses. If anything this thread got me thinking more about how to use them for my own application. Yes I was calling it an Aux Channel (Thats what Protools creates them as) but I did mean a Bus. Looks like I was kind of right thinking that it wouldn't work ""properly"" when using a bus that has saturation or compression on it. That being said, being able to push into those saturation and compressor plugins would be very cool on certain parts of songs that call for it.

Word Clock Sanity Check,"Quick question here I've got three devices of which two have BNC &amp; lightpipe ports, while the third only has lightpipe. In running word clock signal to all of them it looks like this:

* Focusrite Word Clock Out (BNC) --&gt; Motu828 Word Clock In (BNC) --&gt; Motu8Pre Lightpipe In
* Focusrite is the master for 828. 828 is the master for 8pre.

Does that flow look right?

Everything gets set to the correct sample rate (48k) as defined at the Focusrite so it seems like it's working right however the lock light on the 828 does not illuminate and I've got no other way to tell if the device is locked. When I pull the BNC cable coming from the Focusrite, the sample rate light on the 828 (and 8pre) blinks and sets to a different value, which I think is good enough for me to indicate that information is flowing from the 1st device (Focusrite).

At any rate it might be a non-issue as I almost never record from these devices simultaneously. Is that right? Or should they always be locked to each other regardless of activity?",t2_dcsyl,1,0

Anyone with tinnitus?,"I guess that some people will have it in a subreddit like this. I'm 27 and I've been hearing this sound for several years now. To be honest, it has never bothered me too much while sleeping cos I can ignore it. But when I'm using ear plugs to sleep, the sound doubles or triples its intensity (I guess that it is cos I hear less background noise with the plugs).

But here is the weird thing. If I sleep over my ""tinnitus ear"" (It's the left), the sound gets so attenuated that I can barely hear it. And sometimes, if I move to a certain position with that ear free, the sound can gain a lot of volume.

I was starting to worry cos maybe it is something different than a tinnitus so I've came here to ask you, my masters. Do your tinnitus change its intensity (or even pitch) if you move your head around? This is all I've found: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633109/",t2_p951r,5,0

Questions about uploading to Bandcamp,"Hello everyone! I've uploaded a few albums to Bandcamp, and I've noticed a few issues that I don't know how to fix.


1) Does Bandcamp do any mastering? When streaming or listening to the downloaded files, some tracks are inexplicably louder or quieter than the previous. My albums are supposed to flow from one track to the next, so this sudden change in volume is a major problem.


2) How do I add the metadata to my tracks? When downloading the files and opening them in iTunes, there are no artist names, album names, artwork, etc. Other albums that I have downloaded from Bandcamp have all of that information by default, just like they had been purchased through the iTunes store.

"I have some questions regarding volume, distance drop off, and using an spl meter.","So I just recently bought the BAFX advanced sound meter (link: [http://a.co/d/f50l0BG](http://a.co/d/f50l0BG)). I am going to use this to measure the volume of my bluetooth speakers and headphones and make sure that they are under 75 decibels (preferably 70 decibels.) Now I bought this meter because I could set it between fast and slow and use either a or c weighting.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have the basic one and it's ok but I've noticed that whenever I use it and place it right on the speaker it registers about 90 db. When I move it an inch away it drops to 80 or so and when I move it further away it of course drops.

&amp;#x200B;

However I've read that you need to be at least five feet away (preferably seven) for the actual sound volume and pressure to be -6db from what is coming out of the speaker. Whenever i've used my basic sound meter to measure the volume though it gradually drops off and registers sometimes as 85 decibels by the speaker but when six feet away about 60 decibels. That can't be right can it?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried because I listened to music about an average of four hours at around 90 db on Tuesday. Not all at once but four hours spread out between a fourteen hour period. Sixty minutes here, one hour later another sixty minutes, four hours later a ninety minute period, and five hours after that thirty minutes for the last. I know that's bad but at least there were breaks right?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So tl;dr I have three questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How exactly do I use an spl meter?

2. What is the distance for volume and sound pressure drop off from an audio source?

3. I follow the rules that abide by the 85 db and for each 3 db extra cut the exposure time in half rule. However is that continuously or if I take breaks can that be lengthened?

Why are my choir recordings so dry and thin?,"I've been attempting to record the concerts of a choir where I am the assistant conductor, with limited success.  The choir has around 70-80 singers usually with a good enough balance of numbers between the voices and at least sounds pretty good live.  The choir usually performs in modern churches around 300 seats with various degrees of acoustic treatment and are usually not very reverberant, so none of those 3 second echos of old cathedrals.  

Currently I use the Tascam HD-40 on a stand placed 1m behind the conductor, with the mics around 2m off the floor.  The choir would be standing on steps / choir risers in 3-4 rows, standard choir configuration.  The recording I've gotten over past concerts have been disappointing - it tend to pick out some voices more than others, is very dry and thin and sound nowhere near as good as the choir is live.  It also seem to me that all room acoustics is not picked up (is this how it's supposed to be?).  Other positions I've tried:

* Placing the recorder at the back of the hall but that didn't work either - audience noise became a major problem.  
* Placing the recorder in front of the conductor at a low position but that didn't quite work either - in that case it would only pick up the middle chunk of singers.
* Placing the setup in front of the balcony was hit and miss, often affected by audience and also would block view.

How should I get about improving the recordings?  I've been pondering moving the setup further back down the aisle, but would need good justification for that to convince my music director as it will start to affect the audience.  Or should I look at acquiring some better gear?  As this is not a professional organization there is no budget, I'll have to purchase any gear myself.

Recording dialog for video - mono 320kbps MP3 or WAV?,"Hey everyone--

I usually record video dialog with my Rode NTG-2 running into my Tascam DP-008EX and it sounds great. But some of the stuff I have started to produce needs to be pumped out faster, and in many cases I'm a one-man crew and can't operate a shotgun mic on a boom with a moving subject, so a lav becomes the obvious choice. These are effectively zero-budget productions for the time being, so no knocking my cheap gear :D

I have two options and would like your input as to which you think is going to sound better at the end of the day. First is the Voice Record Pro app on my iPhone, with a cheap lav made for recording to mobile devices--[this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016C4ZG74/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to be precise. I have used this in a couple of videos so far and been pleasantly surprised with what I got considering the entire setup was about $10 (minus the iPhone which I already had, obviously). The settings I used were:

* WAV format
* 44,100 sample rate
* Bit depth = 16 bits
* Mono

This generates files roughly 5.3 MB per minute, or just north of 700 kbps.

My second option would be the same lav mic, but plugged into a Sony ICD-AX412 voice recorder. This recorder's best settings give me 320 kbps MP3 files.

My layman's understanding of the finer points of audio engineering tell me that WAV &gt; MP3 if I'm going to put it into Adobe Audition to clean up a bit before using in my video, and that 700 kpbs &gt; 320 kbps. That said, I also feel like bitrate isn't directly comparable between a filetype like WAV and something fairly heavily compressed like MP3. Also, the dedicated voice recorder is appealing for a few reasons such as convenience, battery life, and perhaps fewer hardware limitations in terms of getting a clean audio signal from the mic to the file?

I'm sure I'm overthinking this, and would love your input. Which would you use?",t2_156f33,1,0

Classical vs modern classical recording style,"Recently I've taken on a recording project for a modern piece and it has generated discussion in my class about modern classical recording. 

My professor generalized that the more modern the piece the more isolated the individual instruments were, whereas the goal of classical typically is to blend. 

So the theory I think is that you spot them more and leave a little less to your main pair. 

Do you think this is a correct assessment about modern classical sound in terms of purely recording? Obviously post-production plays a huge role (and the music itself being in a different universe). 

I've been trying to find examples of this sound in pieces I like but I think that the pieces tend to be so drastically different that it's hard to make a judgment call as to how the recording factors in. 

Do you know of any piece that has been recorded in each of the two styles I've alluded to? 

The two I found are this piece, [modern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI3IHt-cD5Q), and this for [classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObF-ujCIdr8).

[Mastering Discussion] Achieving loudness without transient loss,"Before I go into this and before anyone comments, I'd prefer and greatly appreciate if any ""loudness war"" or ""why are you mastering for loudness in 2018"" or ""streaming services normalize levels"" type comments be withheld.

Anyways, I was wondering how mastering engineers go about achieving such loud masters while still retaining such sharp transients and attack. To my understanding, one of the things that can be done during the mastering process include reducing the peaks (with limiting or compression) so the levels of the track are consistent enough to where you can bring the overall volume up and not peak all over the place. However, in my (admittedly limited [no pun intended]) experience, when doing this, I experience a loss of attack in the transients, most easily evident in the drums- all the bite is gone, they sound somewhat mushy. Is it a trade off? Meaning, do you have to find the right balance between overcompression/limiting and loudness?

And I’ve used it on females and males and there’s just that bass heavy muddiness. Is that how the mic is supposed to sound or could their be an issue with the mic or cable? Because I have a friend with a bluebird and his vocals come out nice and clean and my room is better treated. ,t2_meozh,4,0

limiter on lead vocals?,"Vocals are tricky, your own vocals are trickier, but I'll try and keep this straightforward.

So I figured fuck it, and put an L2 on the vocal, and thought ""damn... well... that kinda worked...""

Best Mic for Quiet Vocalist?,"Hey everyone, i'm wondering what mics have worked best for a quiet vocalist in a loud band. The singer in my band has a very soft voice with a lot of reverb on it.

We are mostly playing small club size stages so regardless of the vocal placement it's always relatively close to the drums. Our tech last night said that the vocal reverb was hitting the drums super hard and also the drums were bleeding into the IEM mix a lot.  


I know some sort of hyper cardioid pickup mic would work best but i'm wondering what experience people have with each one. We have used a Beta 57 time to time but have found the output too hot and highs a little harsh.

IEMs with Orchestra,"Hey all,

Got a show coming up where I'll be doing some IEM work for a few performers who are being accompanied by a small orchestra and choir. There will be main orchestra mic arrays (probably spaced pair and some outriggers), and spot mics buried within the orchestra.

Usually for orchestral mixes I will delay spot mics to the main array. I'm concerned this technique won't translate to IEMs because of the positioning of the performers with IEMs (likely somewhere nestled around/in the orchestra/choir), and the potential for the performer's voice/instrument to bleed into the spot mics that are close to them. These performers also have a tendency to only wear one ear of their IEM as well.

I am am music teacher at an elementary school and we put on musicals each year. As the main sound person, I've been slowly improving our sound situation and at the recommendation of some sound tech friends (and due to budget), I went with the XR18. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight was the first show for parents. All week it had been working fine, though like an idiot I was just connected directly to the unit without a router. And of course, like all the posts and reviews say, tonight about 10 minutes after opening house and the room filling up, connection was lost. Even standing right next to it we couldn't get connected. Not with PC or ipad. Had to scramble but made things work. We have our second show tomorrow night.

So tomorrow I get to buy what I need for the show that night. Can you guys tell me of some appropriate routers I can get at my local Best Buy that will work fine in a cafeteria of 300 people.

Weird Freespeak II beltpack issue,"I'm currently A2-ing a show right now: I have 7 beltpacks and 1 freespeak II base station. Everything has been working as it should, except I had one beltpack that I could assign roles, but audio would not pass through the headset, no talk, no listen. I could call the channels, and receive calls, but no audio . I changed headsets with a known working set and still no audio.

I went into the menus on a working beltpack and found that the Auto Detect function was off. Changing this to off on the non working beltpack (it was ON) fixed the issue. Turning Auto Detect on my working pack to ON, and then cycling the power, made the belt pack not pass audio.

Has anyone encountered this?!

How do I practice?,"I've been fortunate in the past to work with a band that had a kick ass practice space where I could do a full show setup using all the equipment we'd usually use at shows, but due to ""issues"" we've had to move to a much smaller shared space. In this space, the band I work with isn't the main band using the place, so I'm unable to use our normal setup or board, or make any major changes to the board or PA.  It's an older analog board, so I don't have the benefit of scenes or anything. We basically only run vocals through it.

The old setup allowed me to play around with the board and try things without the risk of ruining a live show. I learn best by actually putting my fingers on knobs and sliders, so this is pretty important to me. Ever since moving to the new studio I feel like my skills have stagnated. 

I'm pretty green, but I'm at the point where I can consistently get sound that's ""non broken"" (can hear everyone, no/little feedback etc) but I know I can get things to sound a lot better.  

I also have several live shows recorded. Unfortunately, theres not a lot I can do with those other than loading them up in a DAW and trying to get a good mix out of them. That's valuable for playing with things like EQ, compression, effects etc, but not really comparable to a live show.

What else should I be looking at practice-wise? I suspect I was spoiled before with our old setup. I really wish I had tried more things while we were still there.

Speaker recommendations for a jazz venue,"Hey all, looking for some recommendations for a PA system for the venue I manage.

We're a 1200sq ft, [extremely oddly shaped room](https://imgur.com/a/nJSbFML). Our venue exclusively presents jazz, mostly modern stuff. Since the room is small enough, the acoustic level of the drums really dictates what we throw in the PA, which is usually piano and voice, and occasionally horns that aren't way too loud. Our room is sort of treated so there isn't stuff bouncing around all over the place, but definitely still a live + kind of boomy room. 

Our current system is a pair of Mackie SA1530z. The issue I encounter is how the sound of the room changes based on where you're sitting. In the middle area of the room, up to where the mixer is, there's a raised roof that goes up about 24 feet. The room is at it's regular height at the stage and behind the mixer, which is 14 feet. As you might guess, the change in roof size affect the sound and things sound different on stage, vs right in front of the stage, vs, all the way behind the mixer. Additionally, the room also gets tinier (as in like an L shape), so you really don't get much of the stage right speaker in the back of the room. 

My first thought is that the Mackies are raised at the 14 feet height of the ceiling, so hanging at about 11-12 feet, and are pointed straight, which affects the people at the front of the room sitting sort of underneath the speaker, they don't get as much of it as someone sitting in the back. As I mentioned, the room is treated, but the shape of the room is really hard to fight so there's only so much the treatment can do for us. So for now I'd like to solve the speaker issue and see if there's any better options available. For a 1200sq ft room, two 1300watt speakers are a bit much, I think, although I can't seem to find anything smaller than that that is also 3-way. 

So my first question/assumption is, changing the way my current Mackies are mounted, by aiming them a bit more down, would that help the distribution of sound?

My second question is, are there any speakers that may be better suited for the job? For a second I was thinking about doing a faux-vertical array with 4 speakers, 2 on each side, one pair pointing straight ahead and one pair pointing down more, but maybe there's a single pair of speakers that may do the trick without having to work on an array. I should mention my budget for this is ~$2000 (hopefully less).

Obviously changing the mounting on my current speakers would be the cheapest option, probably not running me any more than $1000 for the parts and labor, but speakers I've been looking at have been $1000+ each. 

Hope to hear some good suggestions, and thanks in advance.",t2_lh38z,1,1

MR18 vs X32R,"Hi All,
I've searched through almost all discussion on the MR18, X32R, and the closely related XR18 on this sub--but I still have some questions that hopefully you all can help me out with.

I am a hobbyist, and would be looking to only use this mixer for small ensembles (mostly 6-10 vocalists on handhelds) as well as for my primary interface for recording.  

It seems to me like most of the arguments for the X32R are that it is a more effective mixer at adapting to large scale gigs, and interfaces well with the other x32 products.

On the other hand, the MR18 is smaller, and has the midas preamps.  I haven't had the chance to play with either, but I'm under the impression that this would give the MR18 a better sound--is this true?

Are there any other major factors I should consider? Effect/app differences? The two are at a fairly close price point, so I'm just trying to get the most bang for my buck for my use case.

Help/Advice determining if Audio Equipment is ample for Venue.,"Hello.

I am currently organizing a concert event with a semi-notable rapper and am trying to gauge if the audio equipment that is being provided by the production company will be enough for the venue. First, I think it is important to note that the production for the event is being coordinated by the rapper's manager and is being rolled into the overall booking cost of the artist. This leads me to believe that they would be motivated to skimp on production costs and supply subpar equipment, as it would mean more money for them. I have no serious knowledge of audio equipment on this scale, so I am enlisting your help to make an educated decision.

**Venue Details:** We are expecting 1500-2000 people for this event. The performance will take place inside a 2,000 sq ft basement (concrete floor and walls). The basement opens up to a 1-acre outside area. 2 large windows and 2 double doors on the exterior wall will be removed to allow for sight and audibility of the performance to those outside. 

**Production Details (they are valuing at $2500) :**

* Behringer X32 (Quantity: 1)
* Behringer S16 (Quantity: 3)
* Shure ULX-D Wireless (Quantity: 3)
* EV ETX 15P (Mains) (Quantity: 6)
* EV ETX 18SP (Subs) (Quantity: 2)
* QSC HPR 122i DJ Monitor (Quantity: 1)
* Speaker Stand (Quantity: 6)
* Mic Stands (Quantity: 2)
* Audio Cable Kit (Quantity: 1)
* Audio Power Cable Kit (Quantity: 1)
* LABOR: Audio Engineer 1(Quantity: 1)
* LABOR: Stage Hands (Quantity: 2)

**Questions:**

1. Is a value of $2500 fair for this amount of equipment? If not, any suggestions for other production options? (Located in SC)
2. Will this amount of equipment provide ample sound performance, not only inside the basement but to the aprox. 1000 people in the outdoor area? If not, what do I need to ask for to get the performance I am looking for? (Power output is not a problem. We have more than enough.)
3. The absence of lighting equipment is something that is bothering me. If I were to ask for a standard/budget lighting setup for inside the basement, how much should I expect the price to increase?

Thanks in advance for any and all advice on this subject. It is greatly appreciated.",t2_2j0a7p02,24,1

Traditions concerning turning on orchestra mics for tuning,"Folks working with pits/orchestras regularly, is there an established tradition when it comes to turning on the mics in the pit? Specifically, do you turn on the mics when they start tuning so you can maintain that's what they're going to sound like throughout the show, or do you wait until they're done because that's when the show 'starts'?

Acoustic baffles for misbehaving guitarists?,"Hey guys. Working in small venues as I do, guitar volume is always a problem.

Obviously turning the amp down is the first port of call, but if the show has started and the guitarist turns up, often I can't even get on stage to turn it down.

Thoughts on Bose's RoomMatch arrays? Just wrapped our shiny new install,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/2t9B8Hp](https://imgur.com/gallery/2t9B8Hp)

I'm really impressed by this system, and I normally hate Bose Professional PAs. This lineup seems great though, because it's based on physical box design, and maximum number of box angle options, rather than digital steering mojo and time delay magic. Those seems to be bose's traditional marketing tools. But there's nothing magical about the design or function, just flexible designs made possible by the number of options for elements you can choose. We have an odd shaped room, with little floor space, and we were able to cover the entire room, including flying the 2x18 sub, from front row to back of the balcony with a single array, no delay fills, and minimal sound directed outside the seating area. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reflections are much less pronounced, sound is clear and full, very even coverage thanks to the single hang, transition between boxes is smooth, and directional control seems very nicely implemented.

Beginner Rack?,"Hey guys, I’ve been following this subreddit for a while now but I don’t think I’ve ever posted.

HELP!!! Waves Soundgrid Users and SD9 Users!,"Hey guys, I’m  in a weird situation with my Waves Soundgrid and SD9.

My Waves IO and Audio and are syncing up without any issues  or errors but my Waves Soundgrid is stuck in some type of show mode.

Looking for recommendations on a portable PA for an assortment of college events around campus!,"Good afternoon all, 

Looking to create a portable PA system for a campus tech team to supply all needs for a multitude of events. These events may include some worship nights with smaller bands, providing a microphone and music for events ranging from 100-500 people.

What's your opinion on staff working for the competition/running their own stuff on the side ?,"Our fulltime lighting guy has started doing his own stuff on the side/ working for other AV companies and i want to see what people opinions are on the subject. Here's a few details on the facts:

**What the company offers him (positive and negative):**

* Employed fulltime 40hrs a week at just above the average wage for a head tech in my city.
* Has a very gracious time in lieu agreement (anything after 8 hours in a day is time in lieu, anything outside 8am-6pm is time in lieu, for every 1 hour worked in time in lieu 1.5 hours are banked, can take time in lieu almost anytime without an approval process, weekends are paid as overtime) 
* Has high creative control over lighting designs for shows and is first pick for all lighting shows 
* He has a pretty high volume of work (but if he ask's for time off i try to give it to him whenever possible)
* Company has pretty high expectations of him (He is our only fulltime 8ton truck driver) 

**What he offers the company (positive and negative)** 

* Very solid and hard worker (with truck license and lifter license) 
* Excellent troubleshooting skills 
* Arguably the best lighting guy in town 
* Using all his time in lieu to work on his own events/ other AV companies. (and its frequent enough that crewing around his away time is becoming difficult) 
* Takes a lot of work from one of our regular clients and does it under his own mini company
* constantly complains about everything the company does (and i mean everything...no matter what i fix there is always something else that is the worst thing ever)
* Convinces other staff to work for him on his events (paying them cash to avoid tax might i add) 

I think that about covers everything that is going on. We had a meeting this morning to tighten up our time in lieu policy and hint out that we dont want him working for the enemy and taking our clients away and he got super shitty about it.

Audio Combiner,"Hey Everybody,

Have any of you ever used a large audio combiner?  I'm working on an installation where all the input channels will be wired to a permanently installed analog split then to a D-rack for FoH audio and a D-Rack for monitors.  I want to add drive lines for touring acts and have the inputs from the stage drive lines hit the same amps as the D-Racks will hit.  My initial thought was a splitter in reverse.  So taking the drive lines from the stage and outputs of D racks in the rack into a combiner that feeds the amps.  Kinda confusing, but it sounds like there are similar things happening in larger venues.  Basically giving the venue the ability to have touring bands bring their own monitor or FoH consoles to use while still having permanently installed consoles.   

I can find a lot of 2 in/1 out combiners, but I was wondering if there was anything that was larger and rack-mountable.  Like 16 in/ 8 out.

Am I calculating amp load correctly? (Please critique my Googling),"I want to install four 8 ohm speakers in four offices for ambient music.  They are rated for nominal 30W maximum 80W.

I will wire each set of two speakers in a parallel fashion, then wire the two sets in a series fashion to create an 8 ohm load.  I will tie these to one channel of an amp rated for 250W/Channel at 8 ohms.

The speakers are rated for maximum 80W*4 = 320W, so for brief periods at maximum power, the amplifier should not damage the speakers.  However, I should probably set the amplifier's level to about 50% for continuous use.

Do I have any idea what I'm talking about? :)

"Trying to buy a sound system for an a cappella group, what do you think?","Our budget right now would be about $1500 but we will be slowly adding more over the next few years. Right now we already have a 
mixer and speakers with an amplifier which belong to members of the group, but eventually we will buy those as well. The objective is to get some kind of practice holding and performing with mics, practicing blend, but we would also like to take it to gigs. We need 13-14 mics and we would really like for it to be wireless as that allows us to practice choreography for competition. There a few main possibilities that I see: 

 1) Get a full set of good wired mics , thinking the SM58. (14 x ~$100 = $1400 including cables, but not a snake) This will be most beneficial to allowing us to hear ourselves and practice on an actual sounds system, but it doesn’t really let us practice choreo. My thought is that if we are primarily concerned about ICCA practice, it may be better to do what we’ve done in the past and just go practice on someone else’s system. 

2) Get a full set of okayish wireless mics, perhaps the VocoPro UHF-5805 (4 x $350 which is a set of 4 = $1400). So these are lower quality mics, but will still get the job done for right now. These would be very easy to take to gigs because we wouldn’t have to worry about setting up a wired system and a snake. They will still give us significantly better sound than any gig we’ve literally ever performed at. We could definitely use these to practice for ICCA’s and do chores as well, they just won’t give us as professional of a sound.

3) Get some wireless mics of slightly less quality and then two of good quality, thinking the VocoPro UHF-5800 for the less quality and then Sennheiser 825 for the good ones. (3 x $300 set of 4 UHF-5800 and then 1 x $500 set of 2 e825) This set up would allow us to have a fully wireless system which lets us practice ICCA and choreo and stuff, but it also gives good sound quality for the soloist and maybe a bass of VP. This would give great sound quality for gigs, but again might be compromising a bit more in terms of listening to ourselves in rehearsals.

Was this a bad work environment or am I just too inexperienced?,"I just got finished up at what I consider the first 'real' live sound gig of my career.  Up till now I've just been doing sound at a small church with only four band members.

It's easy to make stories reflect favorably on me, so I'll try to be fair.

First, the facts.

- I was told I would be doing sound for a ten piece band. In reality there were eleven instruments and four of them also sang.

- There were also multiple guest soloists that I didn't know about until they came out to do their song in rehearsal.

- There was a comedic act that came out between songs that I didn't know about *until the first time he came out on stage during performance.*

- There was a guest band of over ten banjo players that I didn't know about until ten minutes before the show started.

- The venue did not have all the equipment necessary for the show and we had to make an emergency trip to a music store for more cables.

- I had to set up the entire system myself (all musicians set up their instruments, amps, etc but nothing beyond that).  This was the first time I had seen this system, and I was the only sound technician there.

- I was also asked to control the lights and a powerpoint minutes before the show started.  This didn't prove too difficult, but it was another responsibility that I was not expecting that would reflect poorly on me if done incorrectly.

- Despite being told to keep wireless mics on all the time, and that the talent would turn them off when off stage, they ended up forgetting more often than not and I ended up babysitting the mute button for those channels the entire night.

Now for some more subjective things:

- Musicians tended to consider everything my fault, even things I had no control over. For instance due to the lack of equipment and hectic setup, some backup vocalists had to share a monitor mix with some other instruments.  When the musicians asked for more of X in the monitor, the vocalists only wanted to hear themselves and I had to tell them it simply wasn't possible to have it both ways.  This put the vocalists in a bad mood for all of rehearsal.

- During rehearsal one musician ran all the way back up the booth to tell me to turn off the mic of one of the vocalists because she sounded bad.  I found this very irregular.

- In general I just felt very out of the loop.  Guest musicians were appearing left and right.  At one point during the performance there was a mini talent show, and I had to scramble to change things around.  Most guest musicians ended up borrowing instruments from regulars or plugging into their amps with their own instruments.

I hope this doesn't come off as too much of a rant. Since this is my first big show, I don't know what's typical and what's not. For what it's worth, the director said I did a fantastic job and wanted to have me work for him again.  I'm not sure if I'm cut out for this though if this is how it really is.  Everything was so hectic, I had to juggle ten things at once, musicians, divas, EQ, even the freaking lights.  I'm exhausted and I still have a two hour drive home.

EDIT: Thanks everyone so much for the advice, stories, and humor.  I survived the whole thing so now parts of it can be funny memories instead of stressful situations. I feel I have a better perspective on the whole thing now and will be better prepared for the next one.

Need Help with Live Audio for Livestream/Recording setup,"Hey r/livesound!

Was hoping that one of you will be able to help me out with an issue that I am frequently coming across with my audio setup for livestreaming and local recording. I want to be able to listen to applications I want, have my stream listen to applications I want, and record the applications I want as seperate audio layers (can be done in OBS). Let me elaborate:

&amp;#x200B;

Currently for my setup I have Discord on one sound device, and Game sounds on another device. This way in OBS I can specify Discord as Audio Track 1, and Game sound as Audio Track 2. If I dont want to stream with discord sounds, then I can have the stream only listen to Track 2, and record Track 1 and 2. The issue here is that because I only have two output devices, all my OTHER sound from my PC goes to the default device, which is the same as the Discord device. This means that I cannot listen to music when streaming, and the stream also cannot listen to music when I am streaming if I choose to not broadcast Discord.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am thinking would be a solution:  
A system where I can set all my applications to certain audio devices (Maybe a soundcard can do this?), have them be routed into a mixer, with 3 outputs (Stream, Recording, and to my headphones (live monitoring would work yes?)) This way I do not have to change around devices on my PC every time I play a new game, or want to have something else being streamed. My worry with this setup would be latency, I play games so lag is important to keep down. I do not know how much latency would be introduced for a setup like this, but would like something very close to zero latency.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

Would a Mixer with multiple inputs (3+) for each of my computer applications, outputting to my Stream, Local Recording, and Myself have little to no latency and solve my issue of only being able to broadcast a max of two applications?

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions of cheap-ish mixers that are capable of solving my issues, or any other method would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I have tried software solutions such as Voicemeeter and Virtual Audio Cable. When I am recording, streaming, and playing a game this system lags out and has even caused me to BSOD a few times because of system instability.

To address the obvious question, no, it's not a flat line. I measured the loudspeaker in the real world, where it's going to be used, not in a lab. Rather than the line itself, what I'm pointing out here is the differences in each of the presets.

I personally find the gain reduction on some of these presets rather alarming. I would have assumed that the tunings simply changed the EQ curves, but a handful of these have pretty severe attenuation as well. I'd be interested to know what the thinking was behind these decisions.

If you're a system tech, you probably are extremely skeptical of tuning presets like these. My view on this is more philosophical than technical:

* If you're a musician, and you just want to plug in and play, use whatever preset you think sounds the best. That's clearly where QSC is going with these presets.
* As an engineer, however, I feel that EQ'ing the entire system for a specific input is a big no-no. Each EQ has a job, and we don't want to get the wires crossed. I use input EQ for inputs. I use loudspeaker EQ to manage the loudspeaker in the space. For more on this approach, see [this article](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/church/eq-boot-camp-a-regimented-approach-to-effective-equalization/) and [this video by Dave Rat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU9BmupC62c). Now, practically, if that's all you have at your disposal, obviously you want to use it, but I try to adhere to strict EQ discipline whenever possible, which keeps things nice and organized, and pays off in spades on larger more complex systems.

The bigger and more practical issue is that I don't want to use a preset unless I understand what it's doing to my signal. This is the big distinction between the artistic and the technical. It's perfectly acceptable in my view for an artist to be ignorant of what's happening under the hood as long as they're getting the desired results. Not so for an engineer.

Another good example of this is an ""Enhancer"" plugin or any sort of ""magic black box"" process. Lots of these exist. They all claim to make it sound ""better"" but don't elaborate on how. If you're a musician and you want to use it for artistic reasons because you like the way it sounds, go nuts. But as a system tech, I have full responsibility for the signal chain and everything in it, so if I can't tell you what the device is doing to my signal, I'm not going to put it in the signal chain. (This isn't about condemning certain products; it's about educating myself about what those products do, and then making an informed decision as to whether or not it's appropriate in the situation.)

&amp;#x200B;

In this specific application, the boxes in question are destined for use as low-profile monitors in a small (okay, tiny) club. Here's how the two Stage Monitor EQ presets affect the response:

[https://imgur.com/fcNb3kk](https://imgur.com/fcNb3kk)

Yikes. I'm concerned about the gain reduction, and I'm not particularly excited about the 1k and 12k peaks either. But my primarly concern lies with the low end. These are small-format monitors, mostly for vocals, on a small, loud stage so we certainly don't need all the LF response when there are large subwoofers a few feet away. I want to reduce the LF buildup from the floor coupling but not mangle the response completely. In general I'll shoot for a highpass rolloff around 100 Hz. I'm not in love with either of the presets, so I figured I'd ""roll my own."" Time to reset the DSP and start from scratch.

[Looking at the 100 Hz and 125 Hz options for the onboard highpass filter](https://imgur.com/kAuvdvd), I didn't really like either of them. The 125 Hz setting (purple trace) rolls off too high to support the vocal fundamental, and the 100 Hz setting (light blue) is probably ""close enough"" but I'd rather split the difference. Additionally, I don't like that bump around 600 Hz.

I was able to create [this response](https://imgur.com/XcEJqxo) using a combination of a lo-shelf (-2 dB @ 200 Hz) and a 100 Hz HPF along with a parametric cut at 200 Hz (-2 dB, Q = 0.7). Now the LF is more of a mesa and less of a hump, and I'm still a comfortable ways down by 80 Hz. Another -2 dB filter at 800 (Q=0.5) tamed that midrange bump that would have sounded unpleasant with most vocal mics.

The install itself is going to have to happen in a very small time window because the club has scheduled events, so my strategy was to get things as close to dialed in as possible while still at the shop. Once I get into the room next week, I should be in the ballpark, only needing to adjust for the effects of the specific acoustic environment. A theme in common with my previous posts: note that we don't need a ton of EQ to get results. The filters are wide and gentle. Nothing crazy here.

In conclusion, I would say that presets can be handy timesavers if they work for you. Whenever possible, before using one, I'd like to confirm for myself exactly what it's doing.

Mic Boom Stands - What Have You Used?,"Hello, I'm pretty new here and only really stumbled upon this sub while researching mic stands. It's been awhile since anyone has talked about boom stands so I thought it'd be nice to have another post

&amp;nbsp;

What I've gathered from this sub from previous posts:


* K&amp;M 210/9 - Basically industry standard, easy to get replacement parts
* DR Pro boom stand - In between budget stands and K&amp;M (maybe closer to K&amp;M 210/9?), difficult to get replacement parts
* TAMA boom stands - A little more unknown, but said to be of high quality
* Hercules boom stands- Some have said good things about them
* Atlas stands - high quality

All of the above seem to hover around a similar price point ($50-70+), except for maybe the DR Pro whose price seems to be everywhere

&amp;nbsp;

But what about more budget-oriented stands like this [Auray MS-5230T with telescoping boom](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/755878-REG/auray_ms_5230t_tripod_microphone_stand.html)?

These budget stands seem to be good if you aren't lugging them around constantly. What has everyone's experience been like in 2018?

&amp;nbsp;

Also, if anyone else is looking for boom stands: [DR Pro Tripod Mic Stand with Telescoping Boom sold by music123's ebay storefront](https://www.ebay.com/itm/DR-Pro-Tripod-Mic-Stand-Telescoping-Boom-/192299285646) and [Musician's Friend's ebay storefront](https://www.ebay.com/itm/DR-Pro-Tripod-Mic-Stand-with-Telescoping-Boom/163122131240)

Gear for the performer to control playback of backing tracks,"Hello!  I have no idea what my friend needs, and neither does he.  We are both long time live musicians.  Long time enough that we are getting old and slowing down.

Our band does not play often enough for our guitar player.  He recorded  an album of his solo stuff, with him playing all the tracks and singing.

Now he wants to play it live, so he's mixed all the tracks with just bass and drums.  He plans to sing and play guitar to those backing tracks, live.  I've been teasing him, calling it ""Guitar-e-oke"".  Except it *is* his original songs.

Anyway, what device can he use on stage to playback the backing tracks for each song?  Something that would play one track and stop, waiting for him to manually trigger the start of the next song.  Something that has an output that won't frustrate the sound man at the venue.

Looking to upgrade speakers soon.. Need some advice on maintenance and safety tips,"I've been using the Peavy PR12, Yamaha DXRs and Mackie Thumps in the past for the band. Never really owned speakers. I've looked around and the band is considering a big jump into better speakers as we're starting to pick up shows. We're still stuck between a few speakers -- Yamaha DSRs, QSC K12.2 along with a sub (still looking around). The fact stands that these are HUGE investments for us. To be honest, I do not know much on how to maintain speakers and make them last... :/ I want to make sure when we buy the speakers that the band has a general education on safety speakers so you know the heads doesn't blow out. At the very least, I understand that make sure mixer is turned off when no one is playing in case a player unplugs their instrument cable, minimize feedback, don't overdrive speakers , and leave headroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions/concerns:

1. Since I'm looking at powered speakers, what does watts and ohms have to do with active speakers? I keep reading that under powered amps can clip the amps but if I'm using powered speakers, where do amps, watts, and ohms play into this? I think this is more of an issue for passive speakers?
2. With the speakers I've used in the past, I've had to push my faders to the max and gains on the speakers for some outdoor events. In hindsight, I might have been pushed the speakers to the limits, leaving little headroom. Is there a way to reduce that? I'm more concerned about sound output for some events that are outdoors and less than 500 people. With the DSRs or QSC K12.2s, I don't think sound output is an issue, so I wouldn't need to push my faders and speakers to the max?
3. For smaller events, should I still use the DSRs/QSCs or should I try to ask the venue/friends if they have smaller ones? My concern is using the speakers too much could cause them to wear down. Not sure if that is a correct assumption. 
4. How important is the warranty? Do speakers break down easily? If I could get them on ebay/refurbished for cheaper rather than through an authorized seller with warranty, I would to save a few hundred dollars. 

Speakers seem kinda fragile to me and I don't want to damage a high investment item. Compared to computers which are more meant to be overclocked, it seems like pushing speakers to their limits will kill it. I want to be able to utilize/optimize the speakers to their fullest potential but leaving headroom seems to be more ideal.

Any more tips and common mistakes you see from DJs/audio engineers handing speakers are greatly appreciated for someone who will soon be the owner of expensive-ass (for us) speakers.

We have two monitors that we want to use to hear our vocals while we record, what do we need on a mixer in order to do this?

From my understanding, which very well could be wrong is you have your monitors hooked up to the ""main output"" on a mixer. Since we have a small budget I only see mixers with a ""main output"" and a ""output (volume) level."" This would mean that if the gained is turned up on an input that input signal would also come out of the monitors as well. The only thing we want through the monitors is vocals when we are recording. How do make it so only the vocals will be sent to the monitors and nothing else? Can anyone recommend a good mixer that has this ability and also has a USB output for under $200. ",t2_6hf1231,1,1

Rack case cable management?,"Hey guys - sorry if this isn't the correct place to post, but I had a question about rack case cable management.

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently been recording a lot more live shows which essentially requires me to break down some of my studio gear and transplant it into a rack case. I'm a cable management freak so I bought duplicate power cords for all my gear and an additional power conditioner so I won't have to go about unplugging and replugging all my cords in this process. I figured this way I can leave all my primary power cords plugged into my studio rack, and all my duplicate power cords plugged into my road case and just have to worry about the actual gear.

&amp;#x200B;

To give you an idea of what I'm working with, here's how my current in-studio rack is laid out:

&amp;#x200B;

Monster Power Pro 950*\*power cables resting on top of Apollo\**UAD ApolloDigimax D8

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, I'm mainly only using my Apollo for the live recording, but anticipate having to bring the Digimax in the future. My main issue is that when I take the Apollo out, all the power cords are resting pretty much directly on top of it, causing them all to fall down when I remove it/a nightmare when I have to put the Apollo back into the rack.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you guys go about cable management in a situation like this? As I mentioned before, I don't need to unplug any of these cables from the power conditioner - I'm okay with a permanent/semi-permanent solution, unless I end up having to replace a faulty cable or something of course. My initial thought is a rack shelf so the cables can rest on that instead of the Apollo, but I don't want to just have wasted space directly above the Apollo. Could I screw a rack shelf and my power conditioner into the same spot in the rack so the shelf is still holding the cables, but there isn't a 1U gap between the power conditioner and Apollo?

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips would be greatly appreciated - thanks, guys!

Something Better Than Yamaha DXR10?,"I am a DJ and I have had my Yamaha DXR10s for about 5 years as my main speakers.  I slightly downgraded from QSC HPR122i speakers because of their size a weight, but I loved how clean, crisp and transparent the QSCs sounded but traded that clarity for the size and weight reduction of the DXR10s.  Truth is, I've never been crazy about how the DXRs sounded.  Yesterday, I borrowed a Meyer UPM from work and did an A/B comparison with my 12"" sub and the Meyer simply smoked the DXR in everything except bass which is to be expected.   My wife put it like this, the UPM was like getting hit with soft balls of sound whereas the DXR was like getting hit with Lego bricks of sound.  Now we are talking about a $2000 Meyer vs a $600 Yamaha, but there has to be something out there that is compact and has a sound similar to the Meyer or even the QSC for less than say $1200 a cabinet.

Could placing the amps (a Princeton and an ac15) near center stage at 90 degrees to each other, facing inward and tilted up, with the bottom front corners of the amps nearly touching, be a safe and effective way to eliminate potential phase issues, even if the spread doesn’t feel as wide to the audience? Or, do phase issues just not really matter when amps are micd?

Just curious as it sounds pretty good at home when I tried it, and more often than not the amps are micd and running through the pa panned hard right and left.

Trouble Connecting Yamaha QL5 to QL Editor and iPad,"We have a Yamaha QL5 (most recent firmware) connected to a PC running QL5 Editor (most recent version) through a gigabit router. There is a dedicated line from our main modem/switch running to the gigabit router.

Theater tips for x-32?,"So here's the situation. Long time live guy here. Mostly bands in bars/clubs/theaters. I've done a couple plays, but don't have a whole lot of experience with it.

Help getting PA for band. Small college bars/clubs (50-200 people),"Up until now most venues I’ve played had their own PA, but I’ve been getting a lot more private gigs and was recently offered a spot to be a weekly performer at a local bar every Friday night. I need to get my own PA setup and I’m curious on what I should do.

As of right now, we use a pretty crappy passive speaker system when we cant use the venues PA. Our lead guitar and bassist use their own amps and we don’t run those through the PA generally, Nor do we mix the drums. Just unnecessary for the smaller bars we play right now. 

I also do plenty of solo/duo acoustic gigs as well and this would also be for those. Those tend to be more restaurant/coffeeshop style events, though.

Right now I’m trying to decide between getting:

2 Mackie SRM650’s

Or

1 QSC 12


Now if I go the QSC route, I will definitely add a second speaker down the line, just not yet as they are way more expensive. I’ve just heard these are leagues better than the Mackie’s.

I also feel like I’d be able to get by with the one speaker for now since id mostly need it for the solo stuff until I get a second one. Then maybe we will venture into mic’ing everything through the PA.

Im also a noob when it comes to anything other than plugging and setting up this equipment, since ive never owned or shopped for any. Ive only used what the bars had or used my drummers shitty passive system. But anyways, thanks for any advice y’all.",t2_174wv080,3,1

Help with Aux Sends to stage!!,"I just recently relocated my amps from the booth to the stage to free up some space in the booth. The problem I am having is with my 2 aux sends for monitor mixes.

Trying to make the most from what little we have,"I run the audio/video as an extra duty at my school and have been working on streamlining and slowly evolving the equipment as much as the school funds will allow for (which isn't much) This summer the county finally installed a new mixer/amplifer to replace the amplifier that blew almost a year prior. 

So the set up we had was a separate 5 channel mixer, running to the equalizer, running to the 5 channel mixer/amplifier and then out to the speakers. We wanted to eliminate the extra 5 channel mixer and be able to utilize the channels from the new mixer/amp but to still be able to run it through the equalizer. Photos show the backs of the amp and the equalizer. I'm not an expert at this but I'm also not a novice. I am sure there is a manageable solution to this but not quite sure what it is.

Query: Methods for making two lectern mics cut out when not in use?,"Hello folks. Hope people don't mind me picking their brains a bit.

I've got this vague task to help a local church re vamp their PA system a bit.  They have a consistent problem with extraneous noise from the road, from crowds singing and from instruments giving them feedback.

When they took it to a pro audio install place the method they were looking at supplying/installing were amps with voice activated relays/Vox features.  But the requirements are for two speakers (that's human speakers) and by the time you find an amp with two vox enabled mic inputs they seem to be very high end and expensive as well as having a slew of features more suited to an airport or megamall.  A total waste in a dinky little local church.

Foolishly I suggested there must be some custom set up possible here, if off-the-shelf doesn't have the feature mix you want. So here I am doing research.

The set up is this:  Two readers/lecturers sit or stand at a big desk or lectern quite close together (a couple of feet apart).  They talk in alternate blocks and when either or both of them aren't talking it'd be great if their mic turned off.

Why does this have to be automatic?  Because there's a rotation of presenters and they are completely unskilled and often old.  Requiring them to develop mic technique and/or fiddle with switches and settings has proven problematic before.  So eliminating that would be great.  This is also why anything requiring computer software is out as well.

What I would love is some sort of relay switch box you just patch in behind the mics that only lets the signal through when someone talks into it loudly enough.

I've found products like these:

http://www.optogatesolutions.com/index.html

But they are infra red operated.  Unfortunately these readers are always present in front of their mics.  If they were audio operated that would be perfect.

My electronics isn't very good, so such thing might be impossible and I just don't know it.  I've been casting around for other solutions, like a little relay switch with its own mic that turns on the main one, for example  ( [like this one](https://quasarelectronics.co.uk/Item/cebek-pm-14-vox-controlled-relay-switch-module-with-microphone) ).  But that's an extreme option.

Another alternative is simply some sort of noise gate which we might be able to hack in there somehow.

Anyway, I won't bore folks too much(too late?)

PA Processing / Systems Tech,"Diving in to a new arena of mixing for corporate shows and cultural programs. I get lots of compliments for my mixing though I’ve learned from working with some pros. I’m a musician turned audio guy, ear is pretty sensitive to overall sound. 

This is for the phasing issues a PA (small or big) encounters and how some technicians help repair. Most guys are all on SMAART and the others simply apply a little delay down the line till the PA sounds good. 

Just seems like both work, weighing or out-weighing the pro’s/con’s. 

So much information available online but limited time to read it all. 

I’m hardly in the big arena, most of my gigs are outdoors with speakers on sticks/truss or in hotel ballrooms where we fly self-powered speakers and keep subs on the floor.

Blues Rock,"Hey folks, just wanted to text around and let you know that I feel blues rock, in most if not all guises, is literally shit. I was working the sound for a gig of it, and I was writing some thoughts down about it with ear plugs in, and I got into a spot of trouble with an audience member for it, maybe like a soldier scared to fight, and I wondered if anybody had any thoughts on how we could eradicate this together for good, to stop future generations succumbing to it and to stop kids having to grow up with it in pubs when they have them boards outside saying “live music” but in capital letters. Whenever I hear something “modern” that’s perhaps got a quick nod to blues rock I realised I think subconsciously  “aww that’s cute”. I only just realised that I can’t process it as music. Not a snob thing at all. It’s something else. My brain responds to full blues rock like it’s being invaded by a mindsucking bacteria. No matter how proficient the guitar solo or impassioned the vocal, it still gets me as a total emptiness. Like if pure cliche was a sensation, or an energy, then blues is the epicentre. Beyond boring, into something further, it shows you a 3D space behind the bore, an omni-bore, but it has nowhere to go, it is the blues. It’s like if you’re playing wrestling with a friend when you are about ten, and then they quickly shock you by pulling out a choke hold and squeeze your neck in real quick, and it feels really dangerous and then they go back to playing and say “Gotchya” in a nice voice, that’s like my first exposure to the blues. It’s like my neck is a little bit crushed, so the choke hold can’t squeeze it right anymore, but the hold is in place anyway, so I try and hold myself together and get through it.
The justification for it is that old blues lead to rock n roll. I think that this might be propaganda, and even though the evidence is there buried within the chords and voicing and occasional digga digga, that is no reason to trust history to the extent that we perpetuate this as a reason to give it reverence. No I say, much of my own music can sound like annoying rubbish, but nothing is like blues rock. I think we should have a discussion with each other about how we can best broach a potential decommissioning, to leave it to the few players that really seem to be able to play blues and make it have something. Maybe there could be a license or something you can get, I’m not sure if I’m better keeping this to myself but hope it entertained you. I don’t mean any offence, it’s just I think blues rock is flopcum. Best wishes to everyone",t2_10c5tu01,0,1

EAW Radius RSX212L,"I recently had the opportunity to see these speakers in person and I want to see if I'm off base with my opinion. Maybe I'm asking too much of a professional product. 
Alright so the first thing I noticed was the top plate that overhangs slightly above the amp module is very flimsy. I grabbed it and was able to flex it by hand, and heard all kinds of cracking in either the finish, or the wood structure. Also, the metal fixture attached to the back to hold the dust cover in place isn't recessed so I imagine after a season or two of hastily loading into a truck will eventually cause a failure at both of these points from getting smacked around and dragged along a trailer wall.
Next, I realize they're not IP65 but they look particularly vulnerable to even the slightest imperfect weather conditions. 
And the little windows for each of the boxes to communicate? I expect that to be a failure point and sort of pointless. Again- I'm open to be proven wrong on that. 
The drivers share one 1k d class amp module and apparently cannot shade. The horns are run with a 500w module. The consumption rating (250 watts max) doesn't seem high enough to support the rated power output also, but I'm not an electrical engineer so maybe I'm wrong- but typically if an amp module says it's 1500 watts peak, that's about a 13amp draw. The rep told me they easily run 3 boxes off a single u ground with no issues....
And lastly, why the hell is a Chinese box valued so damn high? 
Now that I'm done trashing the boxes I'll say this: they are light as all hell and don't sound too bad in the terrible setting they were being demoed in. In the real world? Who knows. They just seem delicate to me. Also, the coax monitors that were on display sounded really great and had a really nice flat profile. And were also stupid lightweight. Big points there. 
I'd love to hear your input on this stuff because again, maybe I'm asking too much of the build quality of a pro level box? 
Cheers!

DVS Redundant recording,"Hey everyone,I'm having trouble with my dante setup. I have two stage boxes (yamaha rio's) connected, via dante and a switch, to a Cl5 and a Ql5for Mons and FOH. I also have a Mac with dante virtual soundcard for live recording. This system is daisy chained and works fine.

The trouble is when I try to set up a redundant network I am unable to see/connect my mac to the network. Thus no recording wich is a problem... To be clear, Only the primairy is connected to my mac. It does not work on the secondairy either. Everything else still works. The problem is not the cables either. A redundant network just seems to keep me from recording.

Any Ideas?

Edit: To clairify: When I switched from daisy chain to redundant, I reconfigured the network correctly (DVS settings,Yamaha settings, rio settings, clock syncs, second switch and secondairy network). The redundant system does work, I just can't record with my mac when it is set up this way. The daisy chained system works and I can record with it. I would like to be able to record on a redundant network.

Trying in-ears for the first time...,Using CAD Audio Stageselect IEM's for a trial run with my band tonight. X32 console. I've never used in ears. My question is: There are two inputs on the back of the receivers for stereo LR. Is it typical to run 2 channels into the console for every set of in-ears? Meaning 4 musicians will be 8 channels in the console. I assume the real benefit of that is being able to pan everything exactly how the artist wants in the stereo field? Would that be the only benefit?  ,t2_u2kpw,1,1

[Suggestions] Bar Band PA,"Hey guys, sorry if this isn't the right sub.

I'm looking for a front of house system for a gigging bar band. Thus far we've been using some powered Peavey PVXP DSP 15"". They suck. Not much clarity. Maybe it's me being bad at mixing, but we constantly have issues with them. Plus, we're renting them (for free, band member works for music store). 

Of course, I'm on a tight budget. ~$400 a speaker. I have a mixer, but no power amp. I'm currently using a Yamaha DBR10 for my monitor, and I like it. I've used two as the mains before and they did a decent job, but I'm afraid two 10"" won't have the spread or range necessary.

Need some advice for a small mixer,"I work for an AV company and do a lot of small seminar type events with a podium mic, a couple wireless, and one or two computer audio inputs. I get sent with small 6-8 channel mixers and I'm not happy with my eq options on the mixers. A lot of times I'm not able to really eq out feedback. The presenters love to walk in front of the speakers and I have to constantly ride the fader for the podium mic.

So I want to buy a small mixer to use. I'm thinking something like the Behringer XR12. That way I have full EQ control plus anything else I might need. I think I want more XLR inputs than the XR12 offers though.

I'd like something rack mountable. I could mount something like an Apple Airport Express inside the rack and maybe a wireless mic or two.

I like the price point of the XR12 but I'm ok with spending more.

I also like being able to control everything with my iPad. I'm familiar with the M32 app so if I can get a Behringer or Midas mixer that will do what I need that's a plus.

Micing choirs,"Alright, so I'm having a feedback problem. Can't move the choir, can't move the speakers, so I'm stuck with what I have. I'm using a pair of VP88's stage left and right, micing the far ends of the choir from above about 9 feet up. I'm trying to get the mics as close to the choir as possible so I can keep my gain fairly low, but I still want to capture the whole choir and not just a few select singers. The ensemble kind of overpowers the choir because I can't get them loud enough. Luckily, the feedback is fairly low––150-200Hz, it doesn't sound too bad mid-performance, but it is noticeable, and I'd rather not have to dip out a whole bunch of lows for the sake of volume.

Audio interface vs. old mixer for live mixing. Help?,"Hey. I'm helping a friend mix/live stream a show on Friday. My experience is more in studio production/live performance, but I'm doing it as a favour for him (and for free beers haha). The mixer he's using is an old 8 channel Soundcraft dinosaur, and it looks like the rec out might be a bit buggered.

My question – I have a Saffire Pro 40 which, combined with a specced out MacBook Pro 15, has very, very low latency. I'm wondering if it would make more sense to use this as a live mixer in combination with a APC40 rather than the clunky Soundcraft? I could do much better EQing/compression than with the very basic 3-band on the Soundcraft.

Are there any downsides to this approach – aside from the always present chance of hardware/software malfunction on the MacBook Pro/Saffire side of things? The MacBook has done me well in a live setting over the years with much more heavier CPU stuff than 8 channels w/ parametric EQ/compression. But then again, the Soundcraft looks like it has survived 2-3 decades of use.

Bonham kick,"Greetings, my drummer just picked up a new kit and I have questions.

How do I get a more modern kick sound (for my typical rock and country cover band) without overriding my drummer's desire for the Bonham feel and ""tone at the throne"" with his new 26x14 kick?

Note, he doesn't have port in the front head. I'm the band leader and I can insist on him using a ported head, but I'm willing to leave it be and try to make it part of our sound....if it doesn't drive me crazy.

I plan to continue to use a D-6 on the front head, with relatively lazy dynamics to punch it up a little.

I can pick up plenty of attack at the beater if I convince him to use a wooden ball like Bonzo did towards the end of his career.

So, what mic for the batter head? I feel like an SM-81 is not the answer here :) and it would be nice if it were something less expensive than an M201TG. I definitely don't need a metal kick drum tone. Maybe I should go simple with an SM57...or even an e609?

Am I also correct that I must reverse polarity on one of side of the drum or the other?

"Help out a newbie, will ya? (if you don't like walls of text, just read the TL;DR)","Okay, hello.. So I just made a reddit account(finally) to ask some questions about live mixing, most of the question might sound a bit stupid for professionals, but keep in mind, that I am just starting out, so here is some backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

So about a year ago, in my school, we have finally got around to buying a sound mixer. (our school is rather small) And there was this student who was like the technical guy alongside our schools janitor, who would work out all the mixing stuff, speakers, etc. 

I always showed interest to the technical stuff, and even got to mess around with the mixer every now and then. I was suppose to learn from the previous student about using the mixer, but never got around doing it, and now he has moved out of the school to a theater. And that leaves me as the only student who has access to the mixer.

Now our teacher isn't the best at this technical stuff, so I learned everything by myself so far, I know the basics; how to operate the mixer, using the EQ knobs, AUXes, setting everything up, monitors and avoiding feedback, etc..

And now there is a school talent show coming up next year...

&amp;#x200B;

***The TL;DR version is that I need help with mixing for our schools talent show***

The mixer is a **Soundcraft Signature 12,** Most of our microphones are **AKG D5 Vocals,** for the speakers I have **2 medium sized speaker (sorry, don't know the name), 1 Roland microcube and 2 amplifiers(Sorry again), and I will monitor the sound myself using headphones.** All of the space is mostly made out of wood, and it is not very big, I am bad at estimating but I am guessing like 10m x 10m to 20m x 20m box, there is little bit of echo.

I think I'll manage it just fine, but here are some of my newbie questions:

1.) Is it safe to plug a phone straight to a channel via line in? (I have an adapter, gonna be using it for some music)

2.) At which angle and position should I place my speakers? 

3.) Can the roland microcube, or one of the amplifiers be used as a monitor, if I turn the effects off.

4.) Is it ok to set gain so low, that the sound level is how I want it, when the faders are set to 0db.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if the questions seem stupid, but do keep in mind, that our school has pretty limited supply of stuff and money + I am just starting out. If anyone has any tips in mind or things I should know, please do share them! Thank you! ",t2_2gyvpbal,3,1
What would be the best approach to reach out to local bars offering to help fix their speaker systems?,"The city in which I live is fairly small (210k pop.) and so is our downtown area where university and college students go often.

I want to help fix these systems so people don't get permanent hearing damage - and they'll end up enjoying the club more. People don't realize it, but they'll leave the clubs because their ears are fatigued either through ear piercing EQ or being too loud (or both). Mind you, these are all DJ places, no live bands.

Follow Up: Lectern Mic recommendations,"This is a follow up to my original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/9t1lxo/lectern\_mic\_recommendations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/9t1lxo/lectern_mic_recommendations/)

We installed a Shure MX412 with supercardioid capsule.  I had to high pass at roughly 300 Hz and pull a LOT of frequencies, and we still cannot get enough gain before feedback.  I think we've reached the max, as now basically it started feeding back at all the other freqs that have not been pulled down.

I asked the guy I had speaking into the mic for ringing out to try a beta 87A a the same distance as the lectern mic.  We were able to get much better tone and much better gain before feedback out of the beta 87A, with minimal EQ.

I have to say I'm a little disappointed in the MC412.  I know lectern mics are supposed to be wide and catch all, but it won't work in this venue.  The client was impressed with the clean look of the thin gooseneck mic, but it is nearly unusable in this venue.  The PA is hung above and it probably 12-15 feet away, and about 4 or 5 feet out from the mic capsule (roughly, I didn't measure).  Very lively room when empty, so I figured if we can get it run out empty, it should be good full.  Nope, it aint.

Any advice on running a small 2 stack system in a hockey arena?,"My boss wants me to run our system in a hockey arena. Normally in this situation I would want extra speakers, and work on a set up with multiple stacks to ensure quality sound around the space. However, that's not an easy option.

4 x funktion one evo6 tops


I could bring in more speakers, but they would be powered jbl prx, ev etx, and qsc k12's. I am thinking of setting up some of them as delay stacks, but he wants to just use the funktion one.

Question about equipment transportation and rack mounting 'alternatives',"First off, I apologise if this is a dumb question. I feel I'm looking for something that doesn't exist, but I honestly don't know what to look up to get an answer in the first place!

\-------

A couple of the bands I perform with are looking to expand their setups for IEMs and the like. In an ideal world that means rack mounted transmitters and audio interfaces, a mixer for IEMs, maybe a Kemper in there... you get the idea. In both cases, each band member would be responsible for their part of the setup. I've just bought a wireless transmitter/receiver myself.

The issue I have is that I am by no means a wealthy person, and I can't really afford to buy double of everything for both of my bands. Also thinking long-term, there might be times I want to remove the transmitter, or take the Kemper out on its own. This means that rack mounted isn't a great option... but I really want a way of making sure that when I do play with these bands, we can transport all the gear securely, and when we get to the venue we can still plonk our systems on stage, power it on and everything's sorted.

\-------

The TL;DR is basically - is there a way of getting the best of both worlds here? Have all the gear set up nicely and securely for shows, while also allowing me to easily remove my stuff? My only guess is some kind of clamp rack than using screws, or I just get a rack for myself to put on top of the 'band rack', and suck it up when I need to take it apart. But I just don't know.

Monitor external mic and iPad on headphones,"I hope I am right in this subreddit and you can help me.

I currently use a Zoom H1 to record speech and simultaneously, but independently an iPad for communication through Facetime. The problem with this setup is that I only have the conversation partners on the headphones, but no monitor of the H1 and therefore my voice.

Thus I tried to use the output of the H1 (1) as input for the iPad (R), but additionally get the output of the iPad (G) and the monitor on my headphones – And it worked. At least until I tried replicating the same setup. Even after exchanging all cables, I still get the iPad output and monitor on my ears, but the iPad only uses the internal microphone and not the output of the H1.

But if I keep this setup and just remove the adapter in front of the headphones (2) and iPad output, the H1 output will again be used by the iPad as the primary input, but of course I no longer have sound on my headphones. So I'm assuming there's some kind of short-circuit problem.

I think all cables and adapters are 3,5 mm TRS except for the “RG” adapter on the iPad which is TRRS to 2xTRS.

Can you help me find the bug in this setup, or some other solution? I'm aware that I won't achieve audiophile miracles with this setup, but that's not the purpose either. It is important for me to have the iPad and H1 output on my headphones.

Between The Lines #3: How To Find Line Array Splay Angles,"*I know, I know. I just posted. I'm preparing a PowerPoint presentation so I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone. After this post, I'll shut up for a while.*

**When preparing the configuration of a ""line array"" (technically an asymmetrical composite coupled point source) I start with three pieces of information:**

**1) What is the desired coverage angle?** (From the loudspeaker's point of view, the angle from the last row to the front row.)

**2) What is the range ratio?** (How far the top box needs to throw to the last coverage row, divided by how far the bottom box needs to throw to the first coverage row.)

**3) How many boxes are in the hang, and what splay angle settings are available?**

In the example I've made up, the coverage angle is about 45° and I've given myself a budget of 12 boxes.

[https://imgur.com/fk1kIGp](https://imgur.com/fk1kIGp)

The absolute throw distances are not nearly as important as the relationship between them. In this case, it's 2.9 times farther to the last seat than the first seat.

Let's start with a big ole' constant curvature source and just cover the angle: 12 boxes at 4° splay gives us 48° of coverage.

[https://imgur.com/rcmo0yN](https://imgur.com/rcmo0yN)

I didn't take the time to add big bold lines for the coverage line, but you can clearly see the seating shape. ***The gif animates, showing the prediction on octave centers from 250 Hz to 8 kHz.***

This is a symmetrical array that creates a completely symmetrical coverage pattern. **Note that due to the symmetry, we know that the geometrical center of this array - between boxes 6 and 7 - is on-axis (ONAX) for all frequencies.** That seems obvious now, but file it away.

The problem is that the desired coverage area is not symmetrical. Everyone will hear the show, but the folks in the front are going to hear it about 9 dB louder than the folks in the back. We know this thanks to the inverse squared law: for a range ratio of 2.9,

*20log(2.9/1) = 9 dB*

What about AutoSplay? The software gives angles of

2,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,6,6

(that's 11 angles, because it's 12 boxes). Zero-degree splays cause a whole bunch of problems but what I'd like to focus on here is the problems that Auto-splay presents for trying to EQ the array. The onaxis (ONAX) mic position is the mainstay of the EQ process, and this is where we run into problems: where is ONAX?

[https://imgur.com/p0iUf0A](https://imgur.com/p0iUf0A)

The main coverage lobe - the loudest point along the coverage angle - now shifts over frequency. Why this happens is not a quick explanation, but it has to do with the amount of directional control the array as a whole and the individual boxes can exert over different wavelengths. As frequency falls, wavelengths get longer and the direction in which the box is pointed matters less and less. **The takeaway here is that we no longer have anywhere to place the reference mic that is representative of the array as a whole, and thus no firm basis on which to make effective EQ decisions.** This is not the fault of AutoSplay, rather it's the consequence of having an asymmetrical array shape (created by AutoSplay).

So let's skip the AutoSplay and come up with our own splay angles. The following is heavily based on the McCarthy / Meyer approach with a few little adaptations of my own. For the full story, read [Bob's book](https://www.amazon.com/Sound-Systems-Optimization-Techniques-Alignment/dp/0415731011/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1542162504&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bob+mccarthy+sound+systems+design+and+optimization). The idea behind an articulated ""line array"" is that we can use overlapping coverage of adjacent boxes to create summation and offset the level variance. We need more level towards the back, so we want more overlap towards the top of the array. How much more? Range ratio was 3:1, so let's use three times as much overlap at the top. (Put another way, a ratio of 1:3 between the angles at the top and bottom of the array). In theory this offsets the range ratio, although this is one of the areas where I depart from Bob McCarthy's guideline. I find that a splay ratio 30 - 50 % larger reduces the amount of shading I need later.

**If we divide the array into composites, and we keep each composite symmetrical, we can ""solo"" each section of the array and know exactly where ONAX is for all frequencies**, no different than working with a single loudspeaker. Then we just combine them and use EQ to compensate for the combination effects (namely LF buildup) and we're good to go. The top composites need to go further so in general they should consist of more boxes at smaller splay angles.

Out of my 12 boxes, I did four composites, A, B, C, and D. There's a little guess test and revise based on the angles your particular system can actually hit, but let's go with

A= 4 boxes @ 2° (for a total of 8°),

B= 3 @ 2° (for a total of 6°),

C=  3 @ 4° (for a total of 12°), and finally

D= 2 @ 8° (for a total of 16°).

That gives me a grand total of 42° of coverage, plus the ""fringes"" that extend past the ONAX of the topmost and bottommost boxes.

**There's no magic here. Just keep pushing and pulling and obeying the guidelines of fewer boxes per composite at larger angles as we go down.**

When we translate that into interbox angles (which we need to give the software and the riggers) we get:

(2-2-2) 2 (2-2) 3 (4-4) 6 (8)

The parentheses indicate interbox angles within each composite (A, for example has 4 boxes and therefore three interbox angles) and the transitional splay angles (between composites) are visible between the groups. Another brilliant convention of Bob's that we can't fully dive into here.

The trends are observed: fewer boxes at wider splays as we go down, and the bottom splay is 4 times the top splay, so we've more than offset the range ratio.

Each symmetric element then has a clearly defined ONAX at all frequencies, allowing us to place a mic and apply equalization. The animation shows the frequency range for each composite segment in turn:

[https://imgur.com/efWatco](https://imgur.com/efWatco)

The computer took the liberty of rescaling the color key for each frequency, which is annoying, but the general concept is clearly visible.

[The combined EQ process is tricky](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/study_hall/choose-your-battles-examining-dispersion-pattern-control-in-line-arrays/) and I won't get into it here, but once we put everything together, we can achieve extremely even coverage.

[https://imgur.com/UhJAafS](https://imgur.com/UhJAafS)

The LF lobe will still radiate from the geometric center of the array since the wavelengths are so long, the few degrees of splay are practically ignored. Some platforms allow a little all-pass steering here, but even without it, we have a very well-behaved PA system.

One last note: it's a bit hot down in front, so after doing what we can with splay, a little shading can go a long way. Taking the bottom two composites (bottom 5 boxes) down by 3 dB results in an even lower-variance coverage scenario:

[https://imgur.com/ocptJrh](https://imgur.com/ocptJrh)

Before we head to catering, let's address the shading issue. There's sometimes a concern about how much headroom is lost by turning some of the boxes down. The boxes have the most overlap at LF, so that's where the largest potential losses would occur. In this case, taking 5 out of 12 boxes down by 3 dB creates a loss of just over 1 dB of LF headroom...Nothing to be scared of.

Question on Feedback Noise,"Hi guys, amateur Live Sound Engineer here. So a few days ago I had a gig for a 1 night event featuring 4 bands. There was notable feedback on a couple of performances, overall happened about 4 times maybe over the course of 5 hours. 


The setup was simple, 2 mics, 2 channels for guitars, 2 for keyboards (wasn’t used much) &amp; 1 for Cajon (wasn’t used much). The stage had monitors for the performers and I was using an average digital mixer. 

The crew I was working with didn’t speak English as their first language but one of the stagehands that would usually assist the Live Sound Engineer I was filling in for told me that it’s usually because of the Gate on the vocals. Of course I was confused and asked him to explain further, through broken English he mentioned it was something along the lines of hot levels getting picked up by the stage monitors from the vocals and I had to bring down the Gate threshold to allow more signal in otherwise the voice cuts. I’m just confused as to how this relates to unwanted feedback. I believe the same thing happened during the last performance although the setup of the band was slightly different. The guitarist was building loops on his pedal when feedback occurred. 

Hope some can decipher what happened based on the information I provided and help explain to me what’s going on because I’m still confused.

Between The Lines #2 - Broad Strokes,"*Hi all. Read on for part 2 of the same system we were looking at the other day. Interesting application as it's a listening room, so we're only concerned about the system response at a single point in space. This side-steps a lot of the spacial variance issues that are at the heart of sound system optimization for large venues, but there are still some basics we can take a look at. If you missed part 1, it is* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/9vv55w/between_the_lines_1_interpreting_the_phase_trace/)*.*

I'm going to start by just looking at the left side on its own. There's a great debate over whether a sound system's frequency response should be flat or tilted, and then how much tilt, and what corner frequency, and on and on. For a variety of opinions, see this [Roundtable article](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/live-sound/flat-or-tilted-a-variety-of-approaches-to-the-system-tuning-process/).

Also, check out this [article on the subject by FOH engineer Jim Yakabuski](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/live-sound/backstage-class-a-tuning-standard/). I am fortunate to call Jim a friend and we've had many conversations about this particular topic. For me personally it depends on what the system will be used for (speech or music) as well as the local acoustic environment (how much LF buildup the room will contribute). Ultimately this question will be answered by listening to reference recordings and tweaking the tilt until it sounds correct. Then that becomes the target curve, to which I'll match the rest of the system. ""Rest of the system"" in this case means the other side.

The initial response actually had a slight upward tilt to it. Look at 3 kHz and up:

[https://imgur.com/a9e7Pax](https://imgur.com/a9e7Pax)

This is partly because the room is small enough that a lot of the HF bouncing off the walls and ceiling shows up in the measurement (notice poor coherence) and also partly because we're only about 15 feet away from a relatively large loudspeaker that's designed to throw a lot farther than across a living room, so there's not nearly as much HF air attenuation as we would see further back in its intended application. This makes sense, but it sounded quite bad (as confirmed by listening to my reference music) so let's fix that.

[https://imgur.com/3AoRaS9](https://imgur.com/3AoRaS9)

Pink = pre-EQ (raw response)

Blue = post-EQ.

Now, hold your horses. I'm sure you are wondering about that 63 Hz peak, and I'll get there. I used a hi-shelf filter at 3 kHz to get rid of that upward tilt, and a cut at around 400 Hz  to rein in that midrange bump. That might be a lobe from the crossover (it's a 15"" system and the listening position is vertically below ONAX but 400 still seems low to me), or it might be a modal thing. The deep, narrow cancellations on either side lend credence to both hypotheses, and since they're cancellations you can't EQ them back up to normal (to a first approximation that is true). If it is modal, good acoustic treatment can do a world of good. But that's not within the scope of the job.

Okay, so for the 63 Hz issue: this looks surprisingly similar to the ""sub bump"" that you see on a modern large format PA system out of the box (see [this image](https://imgur.com/iUBw6Nt). If it looks familiar it's because it's from the same setup as pictured in the Jim Yak article I linked above. Jim snapped it on his phone. It shows his K2 rig ""out of the box"" with subs muted and there's still a heck of an LF bump. His magnitude trace is bottom pane, which is the Smaart default). Since this system is primarily going to be used for the owner to play loud rock music, I left it. We're running without subs here so this is actually an impressive showing. It didn't sound resonant or honky during playback. If it ends up being too much we can always go back and roll it back, but I suspect it will work out well for the owner of the system. This is a judgement call, though, so there's no right or wrong, just what's best for the situation.

Usually, we also feed the output of the DSP into the analyzer so we can see the EQ curve on the screen as well. While this is extremely helpful, it's not strictly necessary, and in this case it's not possible since the DSP is onboard the active loudspeakers, so here we just see the before and after response. I'll include a screenshot of the final filter settings from the DSP at the end so you can see the filters I used.

The applied EQ looks like a relatively minor change on the screen but boy, did it sound a whole lot better. I'm using 1/12 oct averaging, which is lower resolution than I usually prefer but because of the low coherence and nasty room problems, more averaging clarified the general trends for me in this case.

**We're dealing in broad strokes here, not trying to go in and equalize every single little bump. For a variety of reasons, the small-scale details tend not to be very audible, whereas the ear is incredibly responsive to the wideband stuff. For example, after listening, the HF still sounded too bright and one more dB on the shelf worked wonders. So by focusing on the broad strokes we can make some really big improvements with relatively few (gentle!) filters.**

Note the phase response before and after is **almost identical.** The filters here are so low-Q that there's virtually no change. This would not be the case for really narrow, high-Q filters, which are all too often adopted by the ""autoEQ"" plugins, etc. The phase shift itself is of course not audible, but the resonances certainly can be.

Now let's go back and see the Post-EQ left compared to the right channel.

[https://imgur.com/I7EgJbx](https://imgur.com/I7EgJbx)

The matched phase traces indicate matched arrival times at the listening position (see part 1), and so looking next at the magnitude trace on top, we can see further issues: the right loudspeaker (brown trace) is significantly louder than the left side. If it's within a dB it's nothing to write home about but these graphs have a vertical scaling of 3 dB / division so what we're seeing here is significant. (It's also audible. It's important to always check these things as we go. A simple listening test can prevent you from making bad decisions based on improper or incomplete data. It's important to remember that the analyzer simply gives us more data, and it's up to us to interpret that data and make an informed decision.)

So we need a gain change. How much? It's easy to offset traces in the software until they line up - in this case it ended up being 4 dB. That's larger than a manufacturing tolerance, so before cranking the gain in DSP it helps to actually determine what the issue is. In this case, one of the input gain blocks in the loudspeaker's onboard DSP was set incorrectly, and after removing the attenuation, L and R lined up just fine.

[https://imgur.com/oYEge6o](https://imgur.com/oYEge6o)

Right's just a smidge higher, but that's okay because we're looking at its unequalized response vs Left's equalized response. Since most of the EQ work will be subtractive, this is nothing to be concerned about.

Right-side EQ choices were similarly sparing:

[https://imgur.com/qzdCJwT](https://imgur.com/qzdCJwT)

Red trace is post-EQ.

and here's L and R together:

[https://imgur.com/t62CyVT](https://imgur.com/t62CyVT)

Considering the bad room, L and R are pretty well matched in a tonal sense. The EQ necessary for this was asymmetrical, because the room itself - as well as the loudspeakers' placement within - is also asymmetrical.

[https://imgur.com/YUVcZE4](https://imgur.com/YUVcZE4)

Focus on the white line, because even bypassed filters contribute to the blue shading for some reason. Note that the macro trends are the same: gentle cuts in the lo-mid and the HF. I ended up with two cascaded HF shelf cuts to get it to sound right up top - again, the analyzer cannot provide this data. Trust your ears, but then look at the analyzer so we can correlate what we're seeing with what sounds good.

Heavy subs on an accoustic guitar,"So a fellow engineer on a quality sound system just had a talented, itinerant, musician request heavy subs on his acoustic guitar. This was so he could get some low end when he thumped his guitar. On stage with him were two local vocalists, one with a shaker and tambourine and the other traded out keys, accoustic guitar, electric guitar and kick drum as needed. There was no bass and the kick was only used if the keys weren’t being played.

At first, I hated it. When the subs engaged it almost had an effect like plosives on a microphone without an HPF (not quite, but close). The musician was quite talented with one of the best live vocals I have heard in a long time. I even bought one of his albums. As the set went on, I warmed up to it a bit, but still over all did not prefer it. He is a southern, country boy who frequently plays bars and small venues. So it isn’t really my area of experience. 

Is this typical in some areas? It was just enough that I could see some people liking the sound as a matter of taste, but I can’t imagine it being common practice everywhere.",t2_kjasx,1,1
Best In Ear Monitors? 64 Audio vs Alclair vs Ultimate Ears,"Hi all,

Looking for audio experts,"So, here's the story.

I  have a security camera in my room and a cheap microphone.  I was  watching Unico and the Magic Island on Sep. 22nd alone in my room.   Later I was listening to the audio from my mic and I swear I heard a  child say ""go unico!"" near the end of the movie.  I don't have any kids  nor have any ever been in my apartment that I'm aware of.

It  gets stranger though.  Later in the evening, at around 8:00 pm I can  hear on the audio what sounds like some song playing very quietly.   There's a woman or a girl singing and something that sounds like a  distorted voice that cuts in occasionally and I think a dog barking and  snarling, then the girl starts singing again.  It goes on like this for  hours and hours.  The problem is it's very quiet and there's a lot of  static.  That plus my air conditioner is crazy loud.

I  tried cleaning it up using ffmpeg's afftdn filter with the shellac  noise type and it worked pretty OK but the air conditioner noise still  drowns a lot out.  I can barely make out the word ""children"" and  ""fingers"" at one point (at around 11 pm)

Also at around that time you can clearly make out the sound of a child's disturbed sleep.

If  anyone can help me isolate the song somehow it would be a great help.  I  just got this feeling that something really sketchy is going on  upstairs.

Here's a link to the audio from the security setup in my room.

Playing with a Click Track/Metronome,"Hey guys, I'm the leader of a church worship band, and I want to start using a click track (no cues, just like a metronome). We have a problem, and it is this: our vocalists like to drag (when the drummer isn't playing) and our drummer likes to rush when he's playing. We stay together, but the tempo is often not consistent. It's a bad problem, and I know that it could be fixed quite simply if they would have a metronome in their ear, but that's proven to be more difficult than I thought. The drummer does have in-ears, nobody else does, but I can get that setup easily enough, we do have the equipment. I've tried to play a click through the drummer's in-ears only, and it works for a short amount of time (while the song isn't loud yet), but as soon as the song gets big and everyone's playing loudly, he loses the click in his headphones to other instruments and strays off badly. If I turn it up in the beginning so I know he can hear it when everyone else is playing, he says it's deafeningly loud. What are your suggestions for me so that the drummer would be able to clearly hear the click all the way through without deafening him in the beginning?

What would be a good sounding PA system?,"I know my question is vague, here is a little clarification.

Sometimes, I will lose the bass because it's muddy and in general, it's not a good listening system as I also enjoy to listen to music alone but that system sucks.

I would love to have a better sounding system. I have listened to a friend's setup with a sub and it was incredible. Maybe I just need to ad a sub and keep the Behringer?

Best approach to repair rat-chewed cables from board,"This is a church sound system. The snake from the analog board comes into the room pictured here (warning - dead rat in the picture).

Experiences with X32 X-Live vs. Cymatic uTrack?,"Hey there,

has anyone already gotten some experience with the Behringer X-Live card versus the Cymatic Audio uTrack card? I'm trying to chose between the two. Application would be in a X32 Compact with Mackie DL32 via AES50. Would love to eliminate the hassle of an additional System to watch (i.e. laptop running tracks live / reaper).

Cymatic is a bit cheaper (150€ vs 200€), but would mean additional cables for a USB hard drive. Behringer option seems to have redundant recording, which is really important with SD cards (not feeling tooo good about that).

Can the Cymatic uTrack write tracks to a USB thumb drive (granted it can sustain the write speeds of course)?

I seem to remember that the uTrack needs some special software to transcode the audio files afterwards before you can use them? Is that still the case?

Does the uTrack provide control via the X32 direct? It has a record button and a network interface, but I would love it if I can just open up a page on the X32, which seems to be the way the X-live works.

"Why is there no ""DAW console?""","It's possible that this exists and I'm not aware of it, so please forgive me in that case-

To clarify what I mean by ""DAW console"" - when you set up a studio or live recording, you'll generally have a DAW and a console that interfaces with it. That creates a redundant situation, because DAWs will typically have a virtual Mixer that has basically all the same functionalities of your physical mixing console.

Even with a simple audio interface without full channel processing, you'll usually still have routing options that operate independently from the internal routing in your DAW, and preamps that need to be controlled separately.

What I think would be interesting is a console that's essentially a glorified Audio Interface + DAW controller, with digitally controlled preamps that are controlled from within the software. All surface controls actually control your DAW's virtual mixer, and all routing mirrors your DAW routing.

The software could be a specialized version of ProTools/Cubase/etc. that's meant to be controlled with this mixer.

The mix engine would be a powerful computer that's dedicated to running the DAW at low latency.

You can then run all your favourite VSTs and plugins during live performances, and you can record multitrack and play things back easily.

Using Active PA speakers with Home theater subwoofer,"I have a pair of Mackie SRM 450 V1 which I would like to use for a house party.

Between The Lines #1: Interpreting the Phase Trace,"Welcome to what I plan to be a series of posts showing  analyzer traces from the wild, as well as an explanation of what information I gleaned from that data and how it informed my decisions in the field. Based on my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/9vac2i/system_optimization_qa/), it seems like some more technical writeups might be relevant to this community. I would welcome some feedback as to whether this is the case, if for no other reason than writing them up is time consuming. Okay then, onto the good stuff.

\--

I'm starting with a common topic of confusion: what the heck is this ""phase"" response trace telling us? Well, it tells us a lot of things, but one aspect of it is something like asking the question ""What point in its cycle was this frequency at when the measurement was taken?"" For a single frequency, this tells us just about nothing, but when observed over a frequency range, we can glean a lot of useful information for us. We need to look for trends.

**Here is a very basic rule of thumb that covers a LOT of the common phase trace questions:**

**1) The steeper the phase trace slope, the more time offset exists.**

**2) If the slope is descending left to right, the arrival is late. If the slope is ascending left to right, the arrival is early.**

Let me be clear: the phase trace indicates lots of different things, but this simple concept will get you some clarity in a lot of situations.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see some examples:

[https://imgur.com/e1CAUEZ](https://imgur.com/e1CAUEZ)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a trace taken during the benchtesting of a system processor. *Note that I personally choose to view magnitude response on top and phase response on the bottom. This is the opposite of the default view in Smaart, so just be aware of that.*

There's a few things to point out here:

1. The phase trace is descending left to right, so it's indicating a late arrival, as I mentioned above. In this particular case, I simply hadn't yet added delay to the analyzer to compensate for the device's latency. The trace gets steeper with frequency because the same amount of time offset will cause more phase offset at higher frequencies because those cycles happen faster. This is linear - we have twice as much phase offset at 1k as we do at 500 Hz, because the cycle takes half the time. The slope appears to be increasing because of the log frequency axis. If you were to view the phase trace on a linear frequency axis, it would be a constant slope. If you have REW (which you should, because it's free), give it a try.
2. Looking at the magnitude display, we see that the coherence (the red line across the top) drops above 10 kHz, and the associated frequency response data is no bueno. This is because the time delay is so much that at these frequencies, the information comes back outside the time window and therefore is not considered to correlate with the reference signal. Think about an echo that takes a week to come back - it no longer correlates with what we yelled to cause the echo, and so it's now ""noise."" That's what the coherence trace shows us - how confident it is in the answer it's giving. Put another way, is the frequency response this way because it's related to the reference signal? Or is there just noise in the room that has nothing to do with our test signal? How do we tell HVAC from LF pink noise? The analyzer will do the same calculation a bunch of times and average the result over successive measurements. Returning the same answer over and over is high coherence. If it's wandering around, or what the mic is picking up doesn't seem to be related to the signal we're sending out, coherence drops.

We can actually figure out how much delay we're dealing with by doing a little math. The first wraparound passes through 0 again at just about 1 kHz, so we've gone 360° (one cycle) back over a 1000 Hz range. 1/1000 = 1 ms.

This trick is more or less what we're asking the analyzer to do if we view a group delay plot. Let's enable that option:

[https://imgur.com/v5SRYpI](https://imgur.com/v5SRYpI)

And there you have it. A solid line at about 1 ms. If the phase shift is caused by something other than a linear time offset, this will not be a flat line, so be careful making inferences about the entire frequency range's delay based on using only two points for the (manual, mental) calculation.

If you're wondering what those little wiggles are, I can't say for certain but my hypothesis is that those are the points at which the FFT switches to a different time window length. Maybe someone can enlighten me.

So let's look at how we might actually use this knowledge in the wild.

This image shows measurements taken of two speakers (Left and Right) in a small home audio listening room (with nasty acoustics, but that's another topic).

[https://imgur.com/LMHdaHb](https://imgur.com/LMHdaHb)

We have a few problems here but direct your attention to the phase trace. At the listening position, where this measurement was taken, one of the speakers is arriving earlier (because it's closer). Which one? That would be the thicker teal trace, because it has a steeper slope (more time offset) and it's ascending from left to right (early arrival). We have to look at the HF here because the LF has the normal descending trend associated with LF drivers AND we've got some bad modal issues interfering. We do a whole wrap (whole cycle) between 2k and 3k so let's add a millisecond delay to that channel in the DSP.

[https://imgur.com/AYGEDu3](https://imgur.com/AYGEDu3)

Much better. In a large venue situation (larger than one listener) this is close enough for show business, because moving over one seat will result in a completely different result. But this is a listening room and we know exactly where the listener is going to be sitting so let's get closer.

We're about 90 degrees off at 8 kHz. A full cycle at 8 kHz is .125 ms, so we don't need much delay to fix this. In fact, a quarter cycle (90°) would be 31 microseconds (heh) so let's change our delay to .95 ms and see if we miss it the other way.

[https://imgur.com/g9bgjGA](https://imgur.com/g9bgjGA)

We do indeed. The final solution ended up being 0.954ms:

[https://imgur.com/I7EgJbx](https://imgur.com/I7EgJbx)

I could have actually locked in all the way up to 16 kHz given a DSP with sufficient delay resolution, but the distance between the listener's ears is multiple wavelengths at these frequencies so drilling down any further is arguably pointless since both ears can't even perceive the benefit, plus I was ready for my lunch break at that point.

Hopefully this was helpful, and not just a waste of my time. I can't say how often I'll be able to do writeups because I, you know, work. And I really like video games. But happy to answer any relevant questions (about audio, not video games).

Any advice of the new Alto TX212,"Dear all,

Any of you had used already the newly released Alto TX212 (or TX215)?
They are less powerful and have less low frequency response thanks their older siblings TS212 TS215 (and even than TS210) , but I can't find the TS in Sydney within my budget, even used.

How do they compare to the Behringer B112D ? I can't actually get any RMS specs for the Behringer, nor any well defined frequency response. (Their pdf advise about the ""frequency range""...wish I suspect is at -10dB).

Thx for any advice.

"To Degree, or not Degree? That is the question.","I am relatively new to the community and would like some advice as a starting audio engineer.  I have recently finished my music degree from a university focusing on performance with as much technology as possible, but it did not offer an audio engineering degree.

I would love input on how to move forward in this field and get sound (pun intended) advice on whether or not I should consider going back to school to get a degree (if so, what kind of degree).  All of my knowledge and work in this field is self-taught along with mentoring from other techs in the area.

Do you tell a band if sound was just “ok” after a gig you’ve mixed for them? i.e. how honest should you be?,"Did a band in a big cavernous space tonight, designed for orchestras. Should hold over a thousand, about sixty in attendance. We were only support act. Never been there before. After the headline turned up two hours late, I had a 10 minute slot to soundcheck them from my desk being zero to doors opening, doing their monitors (pre-rung out well to be fair as I ran my sends to stage through their monitor desk but did them myself from my desk if that makes sense) too. Four keyboards, three vocals, trumpet, guitar, bass, drums so not too bad.
They came off really happy with performance and sound on stage and hugs as I had stepped in at last minute to mix them etc.
They had friends in attendance. 
Then the question “how was it out front?”. They know me from my work with other bands they like and like what I do.
What do you say? I said it was “hard but good enough”.
The truth was, after I sent principal instruments through a sub group, effectively compressed twice, pulled the mud out the FOH main eq, then tussled with the question,” is it harsh at times without mud and seeking clarity” then multibanded the vocals, messed with a good compressor on the main foh, eq’d, eq’d eq’d, flirted with effects then went simple.....towards the end of the second song I had a fluctuating but workable mix going and people were bopping. Still I never felt happy.

System Optimization Q&amp;A,"Hi all. I am a professional system tech. I get paid to optimize sound systems, and to teach others in the field about optimizing sound systems. I am an active member of the r/livesound community and tend to prefer it over some of the other communities I visit due to generally positive attitudes and less animosity towards people asking questions. As an educator, I think this is awesome. I continue to see a lot of questions posted about the process of system tuning, which seems to indicate that there are a lot of people who have questions or confusion about how to approach the process. I would like to help. I would welcome some comments from y'all as to if this would be a helpful thing, and also what form of dialogue would be effective. I'm happy to just answer questions on a post although that strikes me as somewhat inefficient. I'm also willing to write up some sort of guide or technical article, or even organize some sort of webinar or something.

Although I choose to remain anonymous on this forum, I have a bit more ""reach"" than the average audio human due to a specific position that I hold, so it might be easier for me to tap into some professional resources and bring those to the table. (No, I am not Bob McCarthy.) Basically, I love sound system optimization and teaching about it, and if y'all would be interested in setting something up for people to get answers to their questions, I'm down to help, and maybe dispel some myths along the way.

Need help choosing my next pair of loudspeakers,"Hi everyone (forgive me if i’m putting this on the wrong sub),

This is my first time posting to this sub (i’m mostly a scroller) but it seems like theres some really experienced folks on here and I need some help choosing my next speakers.

Some background: I mostly do weddings at small to medium sized venues (usually between 75-250 people). As of right now I use 2 Harbinger V2115 (amateur, I know.. but like most djs, I started with something cheap). These have been very good to me over the last few years and have gotten the job done perfectly but last week (I have no idea how) one of them blew out on me at a gig. So now I am going to purchase a new pair of speakers that will be an upgrade from something entry level like the ones I had. 

I am looking to hopefully stay under 900-1000 U$D for both of them but I want something that will be reliable and loud enought to fill the room for those bigger events. Also, I’d like the speakers to have the ability to purchase speaker covers to protect them on the road as my last speakers sure did take a beating and there weren’t any covers made for them (what do I expect for a cheaper guitar center brand). I’d like them to have 2 inputs (need to have at least one 1/4” TRS) as well as an output for daisy chaining and if they have RCA inputs that would be a huge plus!

Some of the ones that have caught my eye have been: 

- EV ZLX-12P ($349) (max SPL: 126 dB)

- QSC K12 (pretty pricey but damn do these bump.. A friend of mine has these and I’ve worked with them. somebody convince me to spend the extra $$ lol. I know they’re a bit cheaper now that the K12.2 have came out) ($655) (max SPL: 131 dB)

- QSC CP12 (I’m on the fence about these and have heard mixed reviews so I’m not so sure) ($499) (max SPL: 126 dB)

- JBL EON 612 ($349) (max SPL: 126 dB)

- EV EKX-12P (same situation as the K12’s. Pricier but i’ve heard great things.. need some convincing to pay that extra) ($699) (max SPL: 132 dB)

- Mackie Thump12BST (not a huge fan of mackies but i’d consider) ($349) (max SPL: 125 dB)

- Yamaha DBR12 (haven’t heard much about these) ($499) (max SPL: 131 dB)

- JBL PRX412M ($499) (max SPL: 126 dB)

- Avante A12 ($399) (max SPL: 123 dB)

- **** EV ELX200-12P ($499) (max SPL: 130 dB) (as of right now these are my top choice)


I’m purchasing these later today as I have a gig tomorrow so any help would be greatly appreciated!

X32 Theatre Control,"Hi everyone - I've used an X32 to mix musicals since 2013 but over the years I became frustrated with its scene management: essentially, its scene/snippet functions are not suited to managing lots of DCA assignment cues.  Almost 3 years ago I decided to write some software to simplify DCA assignments on the X32, from there it's grown into an ongoing side project with lots of features for musical theatre mixing.

Back in June I publicly released the software on the Behringer forums and it's been used by sound engineers on both community and professional productions.  Since not everybody in the live sound world checks out the Behringer forums I thought that /r/livesound Redditors may want to hear about it :)

Introducing X32 Theatre Control - allows you to manage control group (DCA) cues, include position and EQ presets and FX assignments in cues, edit cues live from the console, monitor wireless microphones, seamlessly switch backup microphones, control QLab from the console, and more... running on macOS or Windows.

"Too much vocal monitor spoils performance, or, how hot to run the monitors?","Hi, lurker for a while. Amateur SE and musician, I do both live sound and play in bands on my local circuit. 

Recently I ran sound for an outdoor fundraiser show, 5 bands on a beach ranging from a power trio to a six member group fond of instrument swapping and mandolins on loud rock songs. QSL mains and sub, 4 wedges, Yamaha analog mixer: the nicest setup I've mixed on to date. All went very well.

I gave the singer of the headline band, a lady with a stellar voice, great mic technique, and huge presence the monitor mix we worked out in soundcheck. Her voice came out super timid, so much so that I had a trouble getting her voice up over the band in the FOH mix. Eventually, out of options, I turned her monitor _down_ to try and force her to sing a bit harder, and that seemed to do it: she started letting rip again and it was vastly better. Fortunately I got this done early in the set. I've since done a couple of shows myself with quiet monitors and I've had to belt to hear myself, and people have commented on how much my vocals have improved!

So is this too-much-vocal a known thing to the monitor mixers here? Does this happen a lot with amateur bands? Or, more likely, the fault is mine: maybe I was just running the monitors too hot overall? Hard to judge when the bands tell you everything is fine. What else should I have done?",t2_79w1e,3,1

Live sound questions for a two-piece rock duo,"Hey everybody,

I hope I'm in the right place to ask this, I play guitar in a two man rock group I formed with my friend. Right now we just play cover songs in his bedroom for fun a few times a week, but I'm interested in getting us to sound the best we can because if we get good enough I wouldn't mind looking into live performance for fun at open mics or what have you.

My guitar signal is coming out of a VOX AC15C1 combo amp and he is playing his electronic drums through a small set of stereo speakers with a subwoofer. 

It sounds alright as is, but the way I hear it I seem to hear myself, and him, but it doesn't really sound like one overall mix. The two sounds don't seem to layer with one another and sound disjointed, even though we're playing in time with one another.

I realize there are infinitely many factors to consider when looking at live sound or audio in general (size/acoustics of the room, amp placement, volume levels, guitar tone and drum sounds, etc.) This could be just an issue with how we currently have the amp/speakers set up in the room, but I was curious to see if any of you have some quick tips or advice for making a two-piece band like ours sound as good as it can in a bedroom environment (or possibly beyond)

Instead of getting the signal from the Mixer (out) to my laptop  (in) via USB cable. I am sending my laptop signal (out) to the mixer (in). So I am sending my laptop audio to the speaker and the mixer and I don't want that. (Pushing to USB thru button doesn't help) 

My goal is to basically get the mic sound to my laptop and stream it.  How do I send my mixer signal OUT to my laptop via USB instead of receiving signal IN the mixer from my laptop via USB?? Thank you!

Getting up and running with the Behringer XR18 - Router &amp; Tablet,"Hi guys

I'm just about to pull the trigger on an XR18 for a new set up. After many searches it seems an external router is a must. I'm buying off thomann and to cut shipping costs it seems easiest to buy the router from them also however, only one is available [https://www.thomann.de/intl/swissonic\_basic\_router.htm](https://www.thomann.de/intl/swissonic_basic_router.htm) Does anyone have any experience with this. Will it do the trick?  


Second question is a tablet. I don't own an iPad but would like to get a dedicated tablet for mixing. From what I've read android is the better choice. Any suggestions? A big (ish) display would be nice. Sub €150 would also be a plus.   


Also I found a video where the 18/18 IO was working on a tablet.  
Has anyone tried this? Seems almost too good to be true to not have to lug a laptop to the gig.   


I belive a dongle (ethernet to usb was used) and Auria although this I believe is for IOS only.   
i'm not against Ipad but forking out 600 for one at the moment is out of the question.   


Any help form anyone running a similar rig appreciated!

Spectrum Sadness,"Hi all

I was wondering if anyone changes the noise threshold of their wireless receivers for shows

the only space In the spectrum I can exist on is recently full of low level break in from something or other

By default the noise threshold on the Sennheiser units is at 5db I'm pretty sure?, this low level break is probably only at around 10db and I can see it interefering when my mics are off. 

Do you guys ever experience this problem and find that altering the noise threshold to maybe something like 15db gets rid of this low level interference or does this then prove problematic in terms of headroom for your mics/iem's

Anyone work with the Soundcraft Ui24r? Am I being an idiot for considering not accepting more jobs using it?,"I just got done mixing a small festival recently running FoH and Monitors off of a Soundcraft Ui24r. The DBX FRS2 integration is amazing, but I’ve found that the mixer control surface itself will randomly restart during the middle of performances and force me to wait about a minute before being able to make any adjustments in the mixer. The touch screen also became much less accurate after using it for a while. The menu for Aux masters is a few clicks away so if I need to get to them fast to fix any issues it’s impossible. The same goes for all the faders because it can only display so many without scrolling over to the rest. The meters are hard to read and determine what sources is causing an issue in comparison to other mixers.

I personally feel like this is dangerous in the case of feedback - to me my number one priority is the safety of the musicians and crowd, and this system makes it very hard to fix any problems as quick as I should. Is that a valid reason to not accept a gig in any of your opinions? The system worked and I only had about 3 issues through the entire festival, but even then I feel like I didn’t fix them as fast as I could. I don’t feel comfortable being held responsible for any issues in a faulty system that isn’t mine.",t2_1u8s7qhk,2,1

PA System upgrade questions,"Hello all

This is my first reddit post ! Hopefully I'm doing this right

Anyway -- My truck has a public address (PA) system that is used for volunteering for events at a nearby venue

PA System Model:

The PA system is installed and working, but the PTT mic functionality is not very loud. Does anyone have suggestions on how I could make it louder? Maybe I could attach a preamp to it? Open to any ideas and how you would implement them since I'm not experienced with sound or electrical systems. Since the sirens on the PA System are loud, I think the PTT functionality might just need an input boost, but there's probably many ways to address this

Also I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how they would hook up the ""Radio"" functionality to the car stereo. This feature is mentioned in the online docs for this PA system but I was wondering if anyone had further suggestions or ideas. Would be a nice-to-have feature, but not critical, especially if the hookup is challenging.

Anyway, thank you in advance !

Line-array recommendations?,"So a venue I'm involved with is gonna be buying a new line array system. Me and a few of the other techs are going to a meeting later tonight to have a discussion with management about what we should buy.

We have an offer standing for an Outline Mantas 28 rig. On the pro side, it has good coverage (120° horizontal) which is neseccary in that room, is affordable, and we already have outline subs and controllers. As for the cons, it's not very rider friendly at all, we're sceptical about its reliability as we'd had issues with Outline stuff before, and they sound average at best.

So what I'm asking is: do any of you have suggestions for line array tops that offer good horizontal coverage (around 120°) and isn't that much more expensive than the Mantas, while being more reliable and rider friendly?

Also, if you've got any good arguments as for why they shouldn't just go with the cheapest offer (as the management often like to do) but rather spend a couple thousand bucks extra on a mid-tier d&amp;b rig or something, I'd like to hear it and present it to them! :) ",t2_9lunj6d,3,1

Stereo Outputs are too quiet through my mixer?,"My setup is very limited (largely due to being poor college student). I also apologize if my question and terminology is very nooby.

I recently bought a new mixer -- **Soundcraft Signature 12 MTK** for multi-track recording and live performances with my friend's band. I have all the instruments setup for recording and jamming (as equipment test for our gig in 2 weeks), monitor sounds good, but when we stereo output our pair speakers, **Peavey Pr 12 NEO,** the volume is so quiet is hardly audible. Even with faders at every channel and master at max. Even pushing the gains to max is still too quiet (plus with clipping). At this max'd output volume, it will be drowned out at a 400 sq ft room with 20 people talking at talking levels. Our amps output a louder sound, but I don't want to risk damaging the amps. I have tested my mixer with some my university's Yamaha speakers (they have XLR inputs, if that helps) at school events and they output volume just fine.

Power cycle the bodypack and it comes back for a few minutes, but then cuts out again, leaving us with nothing but a quiet buzz.

Since I've got a solid RF signal, I'm inclined to believe it's not a problem with the radio. Shure says they're going to destroy the M1 gear when they get it back anyway; is there a part I can swap in from the M1's to get the J1 pack back in service?

Wireless mic trouble in stadium,"Our marching band has a tight budget, so we got a cheap four-channel wireless system. Already planning to upgrade, but before we spend money I'm trying to figure out what our problem is.

At our last performance in a high school stadium, three of the four mics failed. They had fresh batteries, worked earlier that day, and when we tested immediately after in a different part of the school grounds, they all worked fine. But during the show, the receiver didn't get any signal from three of the mics. The performers said they were all on (they've done this before so I believe them). Each one uses a different fixed frequency (in the mid-200's). Receiver is on the sidelines and performers are up to 100ft away (some are 20-30 ft away). This had also happened in a high school basketball court (same 3 mics not working).

Could there be some PA interference that would cause them to not get any signal at all to the receiver? Something else? What should I look for in a mic system upgrade?

Response to feedback from bands,"Im employed at a music venue/bar 2-3 nights a week.
Ive been here almost 6 months now and It's probably the best place I get to mix.

We usually do 2-3 bands per night 8pm-2:30am 5 nights a week depending on the booking but because it's not really a dedicated music venue we rarely do soundchecks as many of the bands have been playing here for quite some time and it wouldn't be as cost effective for the business. 


The manager is happy with my work, the other techs though not often here while I'm working like my mixing so far and the bar staff are appreciative that I mix a bit quieter than the other guys when I can. I usually get some positive comments from bands about to go on about the previous band at least one a fortnight so I'm pretty confident in doing a decent job 


That said I occasionally get comments about my sound that come in one of the following general forms.

-""man you gotta pump those vocals/bass/kick ay"" 10-15 seconds after we start.

These people tend to be trying to be genuinely helpful and know enough to know what I'm doing in the first place but not enough to know that the first minute of any band in this place is going to sound significantly worse than at the 10 minute mark.

-""hey I can't hear (name of band member I don't remember)""

These tend to be older friends of a specific band member whose only comment is about the person they know. I check to make sure I'm still happy with the level and clarity of their (usually) voice but to some degree I think they're being influenced by their relationship with one person and preference over a better overall sound.

-A general comment about how either the whole thing or a specific instrument/person sounds one of two things, either muddy, washed out or occasionally 

Again I usually check whatever comment is made, whether or not the singer has started swallowing the mic or if the guitarist has smashed on some distortion and that my reverbs/delays are under control etc.


My biggest issue Ive had so far is when a friend or SO or something from one of the band members tells them what they think about the sound in the vein of one of the vague above formats or something else artsy and 'descriptive'. I feel like they think they're being helpful, and honestly I appreciate the effort. That said i just don't know how they expect me to incorporate the vauge comments of their girlfriend who played accoustic guitar in high school and works at a movie theatre sitting in the back corner.

Headworn mics for Children's/Youth Theater," 

I'm the A/V guy for a small local children's theater (grades 1-9). For each show, we try to mic anywhere from 10-12 kids (who will be trading off mics once and awhile between scenes). We've invested in \[5\] Audio Technica System 10 systems with PRO 92cW-TH headworn microphones. I've had very good look with them and love the sound (as well as the 'miniature' size of the mic, since it works well with the kids smaller faces). The other 6 or 7 systems I use are kind of a mix and lower quality (although some are old shure systems). During the first few seasons, we found out very quickly that kids don't take care of their mics, and we were buying replacements left and right. I ended up taking a chance on some cheap/crappy Pyle mics, just because they were like $20 a piece. (Yes, I know you get what you pay for.) The sound is TERRIBLE - to no surprise - mainly because no matter where the mic is placed, it picks up breathing. So, my question is, is there a decent headworn mic out there that anyone would suggest for a children's theater (and not the big ol' headgear mics)? Or am I just going to have to drop $100+ each time a mic goes out?

Note: The suggestions can either be for full mic systems, or just headworn mics minus the system. And again, it's not necessarily professional-grade, as this is more of a non-profit effort, and the venue is usually only a couple hundred people a night.  I appreciate any help!!",t2_jxido,1,1

Is the cheapest 'egg carton' foam as good as any for acoustic treatment,"My band just released an EP recorded in pretty poor conditions (a granny flat with lino floors) and crap gear, but we just wanted to get the songs out so we were not too fussy. We have started writing for our next record and have already started collecting significant upgrades in recording equipment, which already makes a world of difference may I say. 

This time around we are looking to record live to try to capture something we feel we missed last time around. We want to put amps around the house to isolate them, have our frontman sing in a different room etc. and we want to build acoustic screens of sorts (sort of like an office divider made of wood), about 2m high and 3m wide, to put around the drums to dampen the sounds of the room and cancel any bleed from guitars in the room. We did some rough calculations and if we get the $1 per 30x30cm foam off eBay, we'd need a little over 50 to cover the surface but at the point that we are building this whole panel, i don't want to cheap out on the surfacing if it's going to make a significant difference getting better stuff.

Would a TS cable, and setting the headphone amp to mono, give a mono mix in both ear cans? Would the resulting unbalanced cable be anything to worry about? Or do I need to solder a special cable to achieve this.

Thanks

One Single Ramsa,"Is what I had for a P. A. today. And a mix wiz. No outboard gear, mono, 1 eq, 7 VERY talented musicians, a bad room, and a TON of fun. The gig was in my home port so I checked out the room yesterday before my gig today. I nearly cried. The musicians are world class, and this was a celebration of a hospital being around for 90 years. Sooooooo, the fun part:
It was a church like set up with the ugliest ramsa 12x2 box hanging way up in the ceiling pointing downish. I reference it- it works. Ok, good. How about the miniature delays further back under a balcony? Nope. Traced every cable start to finish, sent a signal from the one speaker that worked (known good source), still nothing. They looked like rear speakers in a goofy surround sound system for someone's apartment. There's a 1400 watt amp powering them.... Likely grenaded them 20 years ago haha! So anyway, I test the first gen Mix Wiz and unsurprisingly it works flawlessly. (damn those little buggers were/are great). Every last piece of it. Yay! Alright let's eq this room a bit. Yep. Bad. But workable. Did you know Ramsa made a 32 band eq? Me either. It worked. Good enough haha! Ok let's check out your monitors. How many can I do? 4? Great. Oh, it's all 1 mix. Oh, it USED to be passive but we blew them all up so now we have 3 different powered wedges we plug the 1/4 inch speaker cable into and then just turn them WAY down because it seems too loud. Then we daisy chain all the wedges off of that.

Holy shit. I explain to the house tech how fucked up that is. He explains some of the powered wedges act funny.... I explain why hahaha! (instead of running a regular signal to them, they've been using a speaker cable outta a power amp, into the powered wedge's input because that's how the PA was installed) 

OK forget that nonsense. I'm gonna eat up some channels on the snake and use a few barrels and turnarounds to get proper signal into your powered wedges and have more than 1 mix.

Anyway long story short, I did the gig today under arguably some of the worst conditions I could've dreamed about and it went off without any problems and actually sounded great. I couldn't believe it. One damn speaker. It made me feel fuckin great because I'm so used having nice equipment to work with that this one made me WORK for something reasonable. It was a shit load of fun, the musicians were happy, the house tech learned a few tricks today, and I got the opportunity to be challenged and still have fun. I have to give credit to the venue crew for providing me with equipment that aside from the delays, actually worked perfectly. I'd rather have working shitty gear, than broken nice gear.

Fun day!! ",t2_51ptf,45,1

Help networking using an iMac as a WiFi dongle w/ Midas M32r,"Hi friends,  thought this was an Apple setting so I posted in the Apple tech support forum but had no answers.  Totally didn't think to X-post it here.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, thanks for the help!!  PS - anyone have any experience using a cheaper tablet like an Amazon Fire or similar for running the M32-Mix app?  That way I can just buy a dedicated cheap tablet and leave it with the mixer or buy a few of them for the band so we don't have to use our personal iPads/iPhones.  Cheers!

  
\-------

 Searched all audio forums high and low; cannot figure out how to accomplish my goal: getting my iPad to talk to my console. Using a Mac Mini as internet connection (via WiFi), ProTools interface (via USB) and remote control for my Midas M32R console (via Ethernet). While connected to my WiFi network, the iPad should theoretically be able to find my Midas and act as a 2nd remote (for adjusting the board on the fly while playing an instrument while not seated at the mixing desk).

I have the Midas communicating remotely with the Mac (using Midas M32 Mix app) which has internet access, but I cannot get the iPad to find the board (via the Midas M32-Q app). The app allows me to type in the boards IP address, but when I put in the same IP that allows the Midas app on the Mac to communicate with the console, it will not connect.

I have also tried using the IP of the iMac, and assigning a manual IP to the Ethernet out port. I figure it’s some setting in the macs network settings, but idk.

SMPTE to MTC Conversion,"TL;DR, does anyone have any inventive ways to convert from SMPTE (XLR) to MTC (5-pin DIN)?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So.. One off gig coming up, SD7 isn't available and we are moving to SD5.

&amp;#x200B;

Typically for this gig, SMPTE is taken in through one of the SD Racks on stage, then looped/routed from a local output on each console, and then into the dedicated SMPTE input on the console.

&amp;#x200B;

As we know the SD7 is the only SD console with this dedicated SMPTE I/O, and all the other SD consoles instead offer only MTC on 5-pin DIN (MIDI) connectors.

&amp;#x200B;

We have visited the trusty Rosendahl Mif 4 boxes, but these are kind of pricey for a one off ($800USD).. Though I'm considering going for the Mif because it's sort of the standard.

&amp;#x200B;

We have used in the past Avid SYNC HD, but these dropped the first few frames (not the end of the world), and are a full rack space unit, and also much more expensive than the MIF4

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently considering a hardware option in the form of a pair of MOTU micro express, as these are cost effective, and sort of fit in a 1535 workbox (still 1/2RU, but maybe I could find room in my 1535)

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, Figure 53 (Qlab) make a little piece of software called LockStep, and while this seems like a no brainer, I'm concerned that I'd need a dedicated laptop to run this, which makes it less cost effective than the MOTU box. My chief concern with running it on the existing machine is that the only computer at FOH that's available is running ProTools Ultimate, and I'm concerned that PT will take control of all the connected I/O and not allow signal to route to/from LockStep.

&amp;#x200B;

DIY Waves Server,"Hi gang,

I have a small project I wanted to work on for some time and just wanted to know if anyone else on here had a similar idea or thought. (Rookie post incoming)

I'm big into my pc gaming rigs and in general computer architecture. I was wondering has anyone ever built their own standalone server for running waves? I see they've reciently launched presale for a new ""mini style sound grid server"" in 2019 where they offer an i5 machine for 800bucks @0.8ms latency @96k.

I have loads of components sitting at home and would love to build a small micro atx and maybe invest 200-300 for small form factor motherboard and case.

Am I really naive in thinking that these machines can be built quite simply? Would there be massive latency issues by running waves native? Would I need to buy something like the Etherface or would it be possible to just run it on a LAN at the same almost 0.8ms latency with enough ram, processing power? 

The idea would be to make something that's rack mountable like that but with the added benefit of it being a Windows 10machine and possibly formatted to run Mac on the partitioned drive for offline show editing e.t.c. A kind of super work computer capable of being relyable for either running my waves plugins live/cue lab e.t.c.

Let's talk about Office Pics,"A few years ago, we had a problem. We wanted a discussion-oriented subreddit, but the way that Reddit works means that easily-digestible content like pictures, which you can upvote as you scroll past rather than reading a text post and diving into discussion, tend to get upvoted and dominate the front page. Photos don't tend to generate much in the way of discussion, and seeing nothing but a wall of people's pictures of consoles gets repetitive.

Our solution was the weekly Office Pics Thread, the purpose being to clean up our front page and make it more focused on discussion, while offering a place for people to share their gig pictures, and for people to look at them, without having to ban them entirely.

This ended up being fairly effective. Signal to noise ratio improved, and I didn't have to swing the Mod Hammer around (I always prefer voluntary solutions to problems over authoritarianism).

A few years later, and the problem seems to have returned. People are posting their office pics as top-level submissions, and when they get called on it they say ""but nobody reads the Office Pics thread!""

We've added a lot of subscribers in the last few years, probably ten times as many people are reading the subreddit today as we had at the time we introduced the Office Pics thread. So, I think it's time to have a fresh discussion about what kind of subreddit we are and what changes, if any, need to be made. Like I said, I prefer voluntary solutions to problems over swinging the Mod Hammer and imposing changes on people who don't want them. Apart from making people mad, it's a lot of work and I'm a lazy motherfucker. I am a sound guy, after all.

Advice on how to remove broken 4pin connector from a Shure BLX1 input jack?,"Hey guys! I managed to swipe a Shure BLX1 for a bargain because the input jack had a broken 4pin connector stuck in it. The button won't press down and is all smashed / impossible to push more, so the thing is really stuck in there! Any ideas? I did order a new jack so it's really just a ""can it be done?"" kind of thing now.

EDIT: Got it! Just smashed the end of the broken 4pin with some pliers, pulled some of the copper pins out, and the button released the rest of it easily. Tested with a new mic and works!",t2_imf9h,6,1
Dante related questions *urgent*,"So tomorrow I have a event where I've assigned to do multitrack recording on the main stage through Dante.

I installed Dante Control Software as well as Dante Virtual Soundcard.

I am running pro tools on windows 10 using Asio drivers.

Whenever I try to select DVS in the playback engine,  pro tools gives me error saying 'The selected audio device could not be initialized, please choose another audio device, followed by 'AAE error -6117'
.
 
I know pro tools cannot run while any other device is using ASIO, but I cant seem to find any solution to this.


I also tried using ableton it actually recognizes DVS but becomes super laggy and choppy and unfunctional basically.

Please if anybody has some experience in Dante , help a brother out from getting fired lol.

P.S - I am currently trying w/o any Dante Hardware. Just the softwares. Will get to do that tomorrow before the event. 

*UPDATE* *UPDATE* *UPDATE*

just came back from the festival successfully multitracked on mainstage using Waves Tracks Live.

And the owner of the festival was also happy with my non-mainstage mixes. Also had job offer from the owner.
Also I am officially part of the festival team, as Sound Engineer for non main stage / Recording Engineer for main stage.

HDMI Sound To Allen And Heath ILive-176,"Hey guys, hope this is the right place to post this but I had a quick question about getting sound run through my board. I manage sound at a theater that handles all kinds of events both live music, and film showings. The issue I run into is that when I play a film through our system the audio and visuals all get sent out through HDMI and therefore the sound runs though only the front of house instead of the entire sound system. I was wondering if I could somehow split the signal and run the audio through my mixer (Ilive - 176) so I could have control of the volume from there and have it output to my entire sound system.

Dave Rat's AES presentation,"Anyone else catch it? He hasn't released the research formally yet but I'll summarize because it's so damn interesting... He started with slides from Coachella, talking about the spacing of the first delay ring, and how it was perfect coverage during setup and tuning. When the sun was setting and the sunlight was shining right into the arrays, he notices gaps in the horizontal coverage between delay towers. Once the sun went down he noticed overlap in the coverage again. That same day, he noticed how hot the tops of his road cases were getting in the sunlight, and made the connection.
After some bench tests he realized that direct sunlight heats the horn material in a way that causes the adjacent, very hot layer of air to refract the sound away from the walls of the horn, similar to how propagation paths bend upward at the hot layer of air above an audience on a cool night. This has the effect of narrowing the coverage pattern, causing the inconsistencies he heard.
He then turned the presentation over to a scientist from Italy who did controlled tests in a lab. The effect was reproduced and studied on a variety of loudspeakers, for which data was presented. Fascinating stuff. Dave suggested that painting horns white would reduce the effects, and hypothesized that the white system at the Hollywood Bowl would likewise be less susceptible.
What's really compelling about this, to me, is that it was discovered not in the bowels of a lab with sophisticated test equipment but just by having experience and awareness and great ears. Hopefully he'll publish the data soon. ",t2_1plyg5jc,135,1

Suggestions for a Powered Mixer?,"I'm unfamiliar with PA system setups, and am trying to get a new powered mixer for my org's speakers. Right now, we have two Peavey SP G3 speakers. We mainly use these speakers when participating in showcases on campus and for house parties, so the largest venue they've ever been needed in was a room that was the size of a movie theater. Looking at the label, it says the peak wattage is 1400 W, the program wattage is 700 W and the continuous wattage is 350 W. If I want to support both speakers on the powered mixer, does this new mixer need to be at least 1400 W? And are there any recommendations with these specs in mind? My budget for this is around $250, so I'm not sure what that can get me in terms of quality.

Me: {looking concerned and confused} No I did not, did you mean the feedback when the singer held the mic low and it was pointed at the monitor?  

Pat: No, it was a constant high pitched screech, it was happening the whole show, My brother has hearing issues, but I was blessed with super hearing and often hear stuff the sound guy missed.  

Me: The whole show? No, I wasn't hearing anything like that at all, you said it was a screech? Like feedback? {knowing that there was no such sound I am now slightly amused and wondering what this dude was hearing}  

Pat: Oh man, I would have come up and told you but I was just here for the last 20 minutes of the show. It was a mechanical sound near the back of the room, sorta like machinery running. You really have to walk around and hear the whole room instead of sitting there.  

Me: Wow, I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I was walking the room most of the night, but I must have missed that noise. So where were you hearing the noise? {I point to the back corner of the room where the ice machine is located}  

Pat: Yeah it was the worst back there! See you know what I'm talking about it. That computer thing you have should be able to filter out that kind of noise from the music. {points to the laptop I'm using for a control surface}  

Me: Well I appreciate your feedback and unfortunately they haven't really come up with a way to filter that sort of noise out. I was looking at the meters throughout the night and can assure you that if I saw what you describe coming out of the PA I would have done my best to fix it. Are you still hearing the noise?  

Pat: Yeah, and it's terrible. Can you just shut the sound system off? It's giving me a headache {mumbles} damn my amazing ears.  

Me: The system is off sir. I really appreciate your feedback on our performance and will double check everything at our next show. You might want to go double check the back of the room and see if you can still hear the noise.

Is there anyway to get hands on experience with several boards just so I can get the layout of them. Like I have principals down very well and mix 3-5 nights a week but almost exclusively on an x-32.

Setting limiters on amps that don't have have built in DSP?,"System tech is my weekness when it comes to journey as an audio engineer, so pardon the silly question. I have some older crest amps in my venue that don't have any built in DSP/presets for boxes...literally just has two trim knobs.

I have all the box tunings/crossover settings from the manufacture programmed in, but I have idea how to properly set the limiters to protect our speakers. I've seen on some newer, higher end amps you can enter the max voltage/wattage, but on the Ashley the limiter threshold is relative to the input/output amount, so it's pretty much been a guessing game, and clearly they haven't been set right because we are having to repair a few boxes.

wireless mic system - battery powered receiver??,"Alright my peeps. I'm on a mission to create an almost entirely wireless battery powered PA system. I'll add my setup after the question.

Does anyone have success with a wireless mic system with a battery powered receiver? Alesis Miclink system is the best option I've managed to find thus far. There are many, many wireless options from off-brand companies on Amazon where the receiver is a small unit that connects via 1/4, but I have little confidence the quality of the microphone would be anywhere near equal to any of my dynamics (sm58, sennheiser e835, Blue encore 200). There are, of course, better name-brand wireless options but the receiver unit won't run on battery.

Setup:

\-MAINS: JBL EON One Pro (battery powered)

\-or Bose S1 Pro (battery powered). I use it for monitor if Im using the JBL for the mains. Venue size dependant

\-Samson expedition escape if I'm using the Bose S1 for main (battery powered)

\-TC helicon mic mechanic (battery powered)

\-Zoom AC-3 acoustic pedal (battery powered)

\-Xvive wireless guitar system (if you've never heard of it I HIGHLY recommend)

Different than usual question: How can I setup this audio art installation?,"I have to do the sound for an art installation at a leather tannery event. A guy will paint leather with tannery related equipment, and I'll record and playback the machine pictured on the leather. 

[Pictures of the venue](https://imgur.com/a/UneykMM)

Instead of paintings like those, there will be cow leather painted and hung to the walls, and no more than 5 pieces will be ""sounded"".

My questions: 

* I'd like to have a stereo sound for each piece. **What speakers should I use?** And how can I make them as unintrusive as possible?

* **How can I position them to be as directional as possible?** The sound shouldn't drown out everything else, and when standing in front of a painting, you should hear mainly (not necessarily only) the related sounds.

* **What mixer or audio interface should I use** to drive the 8-10 channels from my laptop (using Max) to the speakers?

There is a budget, but I have to give them an estimate of what it would cost, and I'd prefer to do it as not expensive as possible (not using the word ""cheap"" consciously, I don't want to do a sloppy job for the sake of saving money).

I hear word from some of my mentors and friends in the industry that I am a good worker and get enough jobs to fill my schedule.

Some days I feel like I'm on top of the world and can make it in this industry. But some days I feel like I am stuck. I am only 20 and I know I have plenty of time to figure it out.

Presonus studiolive 16r vs rml16ai,"Not very familiar with the presonus family but a friend has asked me to look into these two units. Primary purpose would be a rackmount digital mixer for use with a large outdoor polo event. About 4 mic inputs, two line level. Currently done with an apb monitor board because of the routing flexibility and number of sends. We could get by with the l/r/6-8 auxes in either of these units. 

Due to space constraints not currently looking for a larger control surface and 3u is sort of the limit. The price on both of these along with the local inputs and outputs was kind of what he was interested in. Ability to control the unit remotely from a Windows desktop (remote over internet -&gt; desktop, control from there) in the case of being off-site was also of interest. 

What's the big ""family"" difference between the two? I understand with a board based system they 16r can he used as a stage box. That's not a scenario I can see him using. Can the 16r alone use one of those 8x8 stage boxes? That might come in handy. I also see the rm16ai can get a Dante card - but the 16r cannot? Looking at all of these I'm leaning more towards recommending the rml16ai as I see the ability of Dante/stage box connection as a plus for him in the future - unless I'm missing something?

The other unit I was looking at recommending to him was a behringer x32 but it has way more inputs then needed and a much larger footprint.

Currently pursuing it as a career (trying to get on tour lol).

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Mono vs Stereo: I always prefer to run in stereo, I put certain instruments such as guitars, toms/overheads, keys (stereo), and background vocals in the stereo field; and keep bass, lead vocal, kick/snare in the center. Is this wrong? The owner of one of the companies I work as an A1 for always tells me I'm doing it wrong and should be running live audio in mono, especially outdoors. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Running subs off separate output (NOT piggybacking off of the mains): Same guy from previous question is convinced the best way is to piggyback the subs off of the mains. My preference is to ALWAYS run them off of a separate output, and send only the instruments I want (bass, kick, snare, floor tom, keys), with a crossover eq. Am I crazy?

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Front fills: Mono send off their own output, or piggyback each side off of the L/R mix?

Wrapping a lav,"I've was taught that when putting up lavs to wrap the cord of the mic horizontally around the transmitter while leaving some slack where it connects to the transmitter so there isn't strain on the actual connector. I was cleaning up after some work at a new venue and as I was putting the lavs up, they asked me not to wrap the cord around the transmitter, which is fine by me - their mics, their rules.

Lost a gig :(,"I got the gear list which included an S6L.  I do what I always do, which is to be totally honest about my skills.  I told them I had never used a S6L before but I am familiar with SC48.  These guys said no sorry and took me off the gig, which I realize is their prerogative.

Other companies that know me would have been fine with that. They trust me to figure it out if there's plenty of time before the gig starts.  

Is Avid S6L that crazy to learn?  Every other new platform I've learned on the job site with the pressure on, and been fine.

Worried about setting up my first gig ever.,"So not only is my little band playing its first gig ever in a few days, as the resident gearhead, I'm also responsible for setting up all the equipment, including PA. I'm worried that it'll either be too loud, or not loud enough. Could I get some advice?

My initial thoughts are to use my Yamaha as monitors, senns as PA, 4x12 aimed backwards for guitar, and bass/vocals through PA. My total setup area is going to be maybe 8x10 ft, so not a lot to work with. Would it be worth using monitors at all with such a small area? 

Many thanks in advance.

This is what I have to work with:

* weird shaped small bar room, fits ~75.
* 4 piece rock band, E guitar, E bass, acoustic drums vocalist.
* MG12XU
* 2x Yamaha Stagepas 300 (8"" PA)
* 2x (maybe 4x) Sennheiser LSP 500 Pro (also 8"" drivers).
* bass and vocalist through PA.
* acoustic drums with a jacked drummer who doesn't know how to play quietly.
* guitar either DI to PA, or 4x12 cabinet.

On Sunday, I had earplugs in and most bands sounded cluttered. Couldn't hear any vocals and I was just completely enveloped by the subwoofers. It was just BOOM WOOSH BOOM WOOSH everytime.

A tough situation with a church,"Hey r/livesound, long time lurker first time posting.

I just recently got a gig with a church from someone who liked  my work at the theatre, and I'm running into some moral dilemmas with the whole thing. I was hired out for a month to improve the FOH mix and also improve the livestream mix. If during the month things went well, I would continue working there. 

First red flag for me was when I found out that I was hired under everybody's nose, including the technical director. In fact, the TD didn't know I wasn't a volunteer until I was handed a check right in front of her.  Also the position I'm filling has never been paid, ever. So I improve the mix in FOH and livestream the EQs had never been touched, so honestly, wasn't that difficult) and after a month, it seems like they want to keep me on. This week I have off and I was told by the person that hired me, that they would give me a definite answer in the coming week. I come to find out from the TD, that in order to afford me, they want to take part of her paycheck to pay me. I need some advice on what to do with this info, and where I should go from here.

Sound system recommendation for magic shows?,"Hi all - I hope this is the correct subreddit to post this question, but if not, please direct me to the correct subreddit or other subreddits to try, thanks!

I do magic shows at private homes, in catering halls and other venues, and sometimes outdoors. Let's say the size of my crowds are anywhere from 15 people up to about 100 people, so I'm not talking huge crowds. I need a sound system that can be purchased in the U.S. (no international shipping) that comes with a wireless microphone, and also the ability to play music at different parts of my show off of a USB stick and from an iPod. I don't need high fidelity music like a professional DJ, just music for the size of my crowds in addition to the wireless microphone. Additionally, the system can't weight too much or be too large because sometimes I have to carry it up and down stairs when I take the subway instead of my car to some shows.

I have used this sound system for years:
http://floridamagic.bizhosting.com/pas_8000.html

It's starting to get old - the audio from the wireless microphone cuts out at times. Also, this sound system is discontinued, but the new version is here:
http://floridamagic.bizhosting.com/pas_8500_the_ultimate_portable_pa_system.html

That new system weighs in at about 10 pounds, and I wouldn't want something heavier than that. Both system are 100 watts, and cost the maximum I'm willing to pay, $500 (or less) for a quality system that meets my criteria.

Focusrite Scarletts in live vocal processing? Any alternatives?,"Hey folks, wondering if anyone has had experience with this. Apologies if this is the wrong sub for it.

I'm planning a live show which I'm going to run through Ableton. Everything's set to a click/backing track and my plan was to also use the session for vocal processing. Delays that I can automatically trigger at certain points in songs, telephone voicing etc.

However, the last time I did this at a show (albeit using Mainstage) we had to can it because my microphone was feeding back and the engineer said the vocal sounded ""compressed"" even when the vocals were off and I was running the signal unprocessed. This was with the Scarlett 2i4.

I could use a DI box and run the thru into the laptop, but I'm concerned the same problem would happen with the 'wet' signal.

How would it compare with the Behringer k450fx ? I read great reviews of the Behringer which seems to sound very loud for its size. Plus, being pole-mountable is definitively an advantage (I guess I could still position the Carlsbro on a table or stool).

There are even a Mackie SRM150 or a Behringer MPA40BT available on local classified, but they don't have any built-in reverb - and I fear they would be underpowered, and not have enough low-end even for the guitar - so forget the bass / edrums.

Would a behringer eurolive give me better power otherwise? I'd need to find at least a vocal reverb though them which would kick up my budget :(

 I have seen other commenting that one needs at least 300W for use as a mains.  Do you guys think this is true and even for small venues (cafe / pub up to 30 p) one needs a proper powered real PA?

feel like there must be a way to get all the channels go direct to the x32 whether by usb/ethernet/adat etc?

Can I get away with subless EV EKX-12P for support in secondary room,"The following is the situation: Wedding of 150 people in a set of three rooms connected by wide open ""gates"".

Video guy looking for suggestions on improving my live-concert recording game,"For several years now, I've been shooting concerts for a non-profit that hosts shows a half a dozen or so times a year, all from different venues.  The music spans all genres.  For the big events of the year, we have full multi-track Dante recording support from the venue, so we're able to master the final video to our hearts' content and make everyone happy.  
  
On the flip-side, the other shows throughout the year give us nothing.  They might be in dive bars with analog boards, or if they do have a digital board, they aren't using Dante, making any Dante-specific hardware we have or might acquire useless.  At best, I often get a Tape-Out, or a mirror of the Main-Mix that doesn't sound great because the venue's audio tech is only mixing for the house PA, and it wouldn't be appropriate to poke them every two minutes to adjust something for the sake of our recording.  
  
I want to spend funds specifically to shore up weaknesses in our audio recording for these smaller venues, and am researching what options are out there.  In the past, I've gotten by with limited 2-, 4-, and 6-track recorders from Zoom and Tascam...often mixing the board feed with an ambient mic and maybe another mic or two positioned on key things like drums or a guitar amp.  I could continue to go this route, and upgrade to even bigger portable recorders that give us more tracks from physical inputs, like the Zoom F8n or even the L-20.  That still leaves us the problem of where the hell do we get outputs to fill those other tracks though, if the house board doesn't have any Aux-Outs available.  More ambient mics?  Two-channel splitters we put in-line on specific instruments?  
  
Since a few of our shows are always Dante, I've even thought about picking up a Dante digital snake and some stage splitters we could use for the small venue shows, but the setup and configuration time for that seems like it would be incredibly inconvenient.  Not to mention that we'd have to split all the house channels and that's probably not kosher.  
  
Or maybe the solution is to just keep at it with our current setup, because any money thrown at it would see marginal improvements at best, or complicate it to a level that it would be impractical for the less audio-savvy videographers on our team to use.

Dante Multitrack Recording,"Hello again, r/livesound.
Looking for a tip on using Dante to multitrack record, and have a super simple question, I think.
I volunteer in a shared equipment environment where the IT infrastructure is managed by a university, so access to their stuff is sometimes limited, and Dante being fed by cat5....you get the idea. Plus, the sound board in the venue was jointly purchased by my organization (a church) and the uni.
One oddity, they have our/their/whoevers board (AH GLD-80) using the secondary port in the Dante card, probably not a big deal, just odd.
Anyway, I don't currently have access to whatever gig switch they have the board connected to, but I would like to multi track record. Would this be possible by plugging into the Primary network out from the Dante card? I'm guessing that won't work, and that it might hijack the send from the secondary out port, messing with some of their config since the two outs are just for redundancy if a cat5 run were to fail.

Anybody out there have any advice? Basically I just want to know if I can plug into that primary ethernet out port in the back, and be in business without interfering with their setup.

Audio streaming levels question,"Hey all,

So I work for a small venue that does pro tools multitrack recording of the live shows and we stream the audio and video live online.

Here's the thing. The levels necessary for adequate volume on the streaming sites is crazy high. My main output fader has a comp with -20db threshold and a ton of makeup gain. I am redlining the board output, redlining the streaming software, and the stream is *still* significantly quieter than a Spotify or Youtube track or comparable live stream. 

Is that normal? Should I say fuck it, up the ratio and just compress the hell out of the live stream? I figure that the audio is getting compressed a couple more times between me and the listener and I could just mix for volume. But seeing all this red in my systems is freaking me out. 

What do you folk do for live audio streaming? I really just need to know if it's normal to be compressing streamed audio this much.

My tinnitus is still pretty low - mild I would consider but it was starting to get really annoying when I was trying to go to sleep. A friend told me that he started talking Pine Bark Extract to help him with his tinnitus. He’s in his late 30’s and has been in live sound for the last 20 or so years. So I was curious and got some for my self from a local store. Sure enough after around a week I was starting to notice less and less tinnitus ringing at night.

I’ve been taking it now for about 3 weeks and while my tinnitus isn’t gone completely it has been significantly reduced and almost not noticeable if I have taken a few days off from mixing.

The  pills I got are 250mg by the brand NOW. There are plenty of study’s out there about it with a quick google search if your interested. 

Worth the 20 bucks if you wanna try it out for yourself if you have tinnitus. Hope it helps friends!

Does a 4-aux mixer with integrated compression *on each channel* exist?,"As the subject says...

We're a four-piece band looking to move to rehearsing with headphones / in-ears, so we're going to use the four aux sends to drive the headphone amp. Each member can dial in as much or as little of each input as they want to hear.

What would be ideal is if there exists a mixer with integrated compressor on each channel, or at the very least the four vocal channels, so we can each dial in the level of compression we each want/need. (Delay / reverb can be handled as a group.)

I do run a laptop w/ Logic while we rehearse (both for backing tracks as well as to capture new song ideas) but I think the latency would be too much of a factor. (I haven't actually tried it, though.)

I've found a bunch of 4-aux options, some with integrated FX but not on each individual channel. Figured it can't hurt to ask if such a mixer actually exists, or if we're barking up the wrong tree.

I should also mention that we don't have a huge budget for this, and will certainly be looking to buy used as well. So a $10,000 pro-level digital mixer isn't in our field of view (as much as we'd love for it to be LOL).

aes question,"Hey guys got a question for you lot, 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

on a gig recently and we were using AES now from my understanding you can't passively split AES like analog, 



so here lies my confusion 


setup 



J series driven by d80 amps and a midas pro FOH 


6 lines of tails on a 100m multi so 12 channels of AES if wanted 

;

1Left + Right  2 Sub +Front Fill    3456 where used as analog back up 


multi went to a multi pin connector  SR  which was a 2u box with a ATI distribution dda 212 xlr 
and another 2 veam or multipin connector outs one for SR and one for  SL which in turn was connected and in a daisy chain fashion from one  amp rack to another SR
Same happened to SL from the 2 u rack with the ATI in it 

in each rack at the back was a 6 way passive split box male and female 

Exsample of what I saw SR say 
5 into A was analog and set to anolog and daisy chained down the 4 amp 
1 into C was AES set to digital and daisy chained 

Seemed to have been feed from a multi pin connector out into the next amp rack which was another 4 amp and so on so forth  

If you know D80s you’ll know what I mean 


I get all this but this mean you can passively split AES 

the ATI  DDA-212XLR has , 2 in 12 out, so I'm guessing it was used just for clocking 


what am I missing here any advice would be great

I'm trying to get wireless microphone coverage for a fairly extensive outdoor/indoor area. The speaker will be walking with a microphone around an \~10,000 sq. ft. outdoor area and an indoor hallway \~200ft. deep. The last time I did this we deployed three UA874 and a HA-8089 Helical shooting down the hallway and used modified UA221s (as is Shures suggestion on their support) to use the four antenna on a UA844 DA. This ended up not working and we had one paddle covering the entire outdoor area and the single helical for the indoor. All things considering it ended up OKAY with dropouts starting about 100' down the hallway and a few further upstage in the outdoor area. It gets extremely crowded as well which makes it all more difficult to predict after testing where problems will occur.

Pro2c / DL251 Dropouts during shows,"Hey Team

Long story short i used to directly run 3 cat5e cables from my the aes50 ports on the back of the Pro2c to my DL251 stagebox with a roughly 60m run and everything in my life was great.

But this was a much simpler time.

The cables were pretty snagged and not in great condition but it just so happened the venue spent a lot of money on having RJ45 patch pannels around the venue for each with 4 connectors

Being that the cat6 cabling for all these new patch panels eventually all end up at FOH control, being the young whippersnapper i am, I thought that i could go from the 3 aes50 ports on the DL251 using cat 6, into 3 connectors on the patch pannel, which then end up at a patch pannel at FOH, and then from that patch pannel into the back of the 3 aes50 ports on the desk.

So i've been having a great time mixing a couple of shows since we've done this, but i've started to notice that every couple of minutes, the green port indicator light turns to red, then to green, then to red, then to green in what can only be described as a rhythmic pattern of hellish uncertainty. Like really strangely dipping in and out of sync for a good 10 seconds then everything is green again

No actual audio dropouts during the show, just the ports but i didn't want to pull up a red port indicator to incite the fear of god into a touring TM so i can't investigate further, and i was just only using inputs 1-8 and outputs 1-2 and 13,14,15 and16.

I was led to believe the ports refer to channel count i.e

1 is 1 to 24 and outputs 1-8

2 is 25 to 48 and outputs 8-16

3 is Redundant for either

not sure if this is the case or it actually carries clock data?

Anyways

I am severely worried that having these patch panels even with cat6 is causing some mad stuff to go on, and that on the bigger shows with bigger channel counts if this happens i am going to look very silly and lose a lot of audio.

Looking v desperately for help/ knowledge as i am sweating making my way through the midas manuals

Feels like i'm about to be schooled on points of failure but would be great to know if anyone has had this problem before?

 or if the patch panels should make a difference or not, pretty sure the whole signal is cat 6 as well but would using a cat5e in the chain cause some drama?

Wireless packs interfering with each other,"Our guitar player had gotten a new wireless guitar Shure QLX-D to get out of the older Sennheiser that was in the 600mhz.

So we have solved the problem. But because I want to learn more about wireless...what was causing the audio drop out in the ears pack?

I've been trying to find answers via Google to these questions all morning, but have had no luck, so I decided to come ask reddit. 

I'm not working on a *live* setup, just one for home use, but I think you all might be able to help me out.

I recently decided to set up a home audio system and bought some old audio gear off Craigslist. I'm connecting a few different audio devices (CD player, FM tuner, computer, etc.) to a Mackie MS 1202 mixer because I want to be able to listen to multiple audio sources at once (otherwise I would just use a home audio receiver). Ideally I will take the output from the mixer to a Yamaha A-1000 amp and then to my speakers. So, question one:

1) According to the manual, the mixer outputs at +4dBu (1.23V). The amp has an input sensitivity of 150mV. Is it okay to input a much higher voltage like this into the amp? Do I need an attenuator to take the voltage down a bit?

And the other question:

2) The mixer has 1/4"" TS outputs and the amp has RCA inputs. Can I simply buy some adapters to change the 1/4"" TS to RCA and then use an RCA cable or would it be better to use a dedicated 1/4"" to RCA cable? Would using the adapter cause any loss in sound quality?

Best frequency to replace my 600MHz gear.,"I'm currently running a few Sennheiser EW 100's in the B frequency band (two g2's and a g3).

I'm leaning towards going with the A band, to stay further away from the 600MHz range. Without running any frequency scans is there any real reason I should be looking at one band over the others?

Need advice for speakers/sub/mixer for dj events and hosting live musicians,"Was told this was the place to ask this!

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the market to buy a set of speakers, a sub, and a mixer. I am open to using passive speakers, buying amps, crossover, etc if there isn't a powered speaker, powered sub, mixer combo that works.

&amp;#x200B;

I need a setup that can be used for small-mid size events. (20 people to 200/300)

Used for DJing styles of music where pure loudness doesn't do much. Need a clean/crisp stereo image.

Was looking into the EV ZLX 15""s. 90%+ of the reviews seemed like it fit what I wanted and with a sub would provide enough umpf and a great clear sound. Would love to hear feedback on that.

Sub doesn't need to be overpowering, just reliable. Was told a JBL 18"" sub was solid with the 2 speakers (do not know the name, open to suggestions and feedback)

Mixer does not need to be amazing. I was looking into the Midas MR18. It is above the price point I wanted, for sure, but it seems pretty brilliant. I was using the Mackie ProFX12v2 12-Channel Professional FX Mixer with USB previously and it seemed okay. When using it for live instruments/audio, it seemed like there was a small range where I could hear it. Too much lower on the gain and it wouldn't come through, too much higher and it cut hard without much space in between. I am more than content going back to that mixer if you guys don't see a problem with it and I just need to get better at using it.

Then lastly the stands for each individual thing or any other pieces I might need. If I can get a solid, rugged, decent amount of time lasting, clear sounding set up with enough loudness for the size events I'm looking at, I am flexible with the price. I do not need to go crazy though.

gear recommendation,"Hey guys and gals. Just a quick backround of what I am trying to do before my question. I am designing a rig with a QL5 and the EAW radius line.

I like to use my matrices to rout to all of my PA so I can have individual control over all my zones. On larger shows where I have video records and delays and front fill and backstage monitors, I tend to run out of the 8 matrices that the QL5 provides. So here is my ask: does anyone know of an audio matrix unit that will take dante in, and allow me to route to my speakers using cat6 instead of XLR via dante?

Shure BLX vs GLX-D Advanced (or other budget options?),"I'm looking for a new wireless microphone system to recommend for a low-budget operation. We typically use 11 mics per show and 2 handhelds, 8 of which are aging and also affected by the 600MHz spectrum reallocation.

As for the other 3, 1 of them is a 2000 series Audio-Technica that happened to be I band so isn't affected (the rest were D Band), and the remaining 2 are new Shure BLX systems we bought last year. (A-T hadn't updated their line in a long while, and when they finally did they made a new connector that seemingly isn't compatible with any mics they don't make themselves...)

The BLX systems seem nice enough, better than the old systems for sure, but the cheaper materials and the non-removable yet flexible antennas makes me nervous about their longevity. They also seemed quite hot sound-wise last year, though I'm still thinking there's something on our end we're missing on that front (planning to do some experimentation regarding that gain issue this Thanksgiving before audition time to see if it improves..) All in all they work well enough, but we want them to last as long as we can. I think I can get away with pushing a higher-end offering if they'll work better or last longer, but there's no way we can jump up to a QLX/ULX or something that costly.

I was then looking to see if Shure offered a mid-market option. And they do, but it was a 2.4GHz system, and I quickly dismissed this. However their new ""Advanced"" system is causing me to give it another look. They claim to handle up to 11 channels, and if we keep BLX for part of our setup the thought is we could have 6 or so running on GLX reliably. This would allow us to have more RF spectrum to work with to coordinate our other mics as we tour around.

Those systems appear to be better made, the battery system also looks to be a huge convenience (never having to worry about batteries dying in show or convincing someone to go running to Walmart for more again, with time remaining indicators and a rechargeable spare right in the receivers), and they'll never be affected by future FCC spectrum changes. But that said, at the end of the day they have to work, and while we're mostly performing away from dense Wi-Fi areas, I don't want there to be a major problem with the many wireless devices our team, actors, and audience uses (tech crew often sits in audience area)...

Our tech setup is somewhere around 40-50' from the stage (our snake is 50' long so it shouldn't ever be much further back than that). Again we sit in the audience and having the antennae clear the audience has been an issue before with UHF, and I wonder if 2.4 will make that worse...

Has anyone tried this using the GLX-D-Adv. frequency manager with the stock antennae? I would expect it to work with the paddles because they're directional, but because of our quick-setup touring and budget-focused nature, adding the time and cost expenses of setting up paddle antennae right up by the stage probably wouldn't be worth it.

I'm also interested if there are other options anyone may recommend in that sort of price range. Right now I'm still leaning toward just pushing to get more BLX systems because it's still cheaper and doesn't have 2.4G problems. But if there's a better (but still cost-practical) way I'd love to hear it. Thanks for any info!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR -- We are replacing our mic systems, BLX in early testing had some problems and concerns but not terrible, is GLX-D Adv. worth the upgrade or will it cause even more problems? And is there a better option to consider? Thanks.",t2_jdq9m,2,1

Subwoofer Shopping - Help me spend my money!,"Fellow sound guys and gals,
I'm ready to upgrade the Carvin powered subs I've been using for my bar gigs. I've narrowed it down to two options: either the EV ELX200-18SP or the JBL VRX918SP.

The subs will primarily be used when I'm running sound for bar bands, with occasional DJing and drum monitor use as well. 

Here's my main criteria (in order of importance):

- **Sound quality (and SPL output)**
My goal is to be able to cover as many seats as possible with only the gear in my SUV (Highlander). I assume the JBL beats out the EV by a little bit, but do you guys think the size difference is worth the difference in sound quality and output?

- ‎**Size**
I can fit the JBLs, but it's not very comfortable. The EVs fit very nicely. 

- ‎**Reliability and stability**
I trust the JBL name better than EV, but I'm sure EV cabinets are very reliable. I do like the simplicity of JBLs amp. I'm not interested in any sort of DSP or even multiple ins/outs. I'm running the subs from a matrix on my console, so I can do any necessary processing there. In terms of stability, the EV only weighs 64 lbs, which is very convenient for transport, but I plan on upgrading my tops to the SRX815P soon, which weighs only a few pounds less. Considering that the EV is so light and has such a small footprint, should I be worried about putting the SRX on it with a pole?


Here's my secondary criteria (also in order of importance. This stuff is nice but not as important as the stuff I listed above)

- **Price**
The VRX costs a lot of money. Is it worth the increase over the EV?

- **LF Extension**
The VRX goes a lot lower than the EV. (@ -3dB, 34 vs 47Hz)

- **Powercon**
I like the Powercon in/out on the VRX. 

So, in conclusion, what do you guys think about the two models? Which one would be my money be better spent on? I appreciate any and all insight. Thanks!

Shure PSM 200 In Ear Monitor System - Best Sound?,"Hi! I am a singer in an Oasis tribute band and have recently bought a Wireless In Ear Monitor system, the Shure PSM 200. The earphones I use are the MEE Audio M6 2nd Generation. My question is, what is the best way to set them up so I get the most clearest and best sound out of it in a live concert/gig environment? So far we have been kind of guessing and haven't known what to tell the sound guys how I need it so it's been a bit hit and miss so far.

The problem I have is sometimes the sound just completely cuts in and out while I'm singing making it very difficult to hear myself, it can also become very distorted and crackly . I don't know if that is a reception thing or interference? We have tried various channels and it seems to happen on all of them.

All I want in my ears is my own vocal, I don't need a mix of the band or anything so it's pretty simple. The venues we play at tend to usually have capacities of 150-400 people.

So yeah, can anyone guide me and give me any help on what is the absolute best way to set these up for what I need?

How to make a live band sound like they're from the 80s ?,"Hey,

I will be mixing a live rock band (drm, b, g, keys, v) for several shows as part of theater/comedy/musical type of production. They will play cover versions of different songs from the 80s.

I know that they're pro enough to make their instruments sound accordingly at the source, and I will of course meet with the band and the production in a couple of weeks as well to learn what they want/expect from me as well. But I'm very curious for your input. 

**What would you do to make them sound like they're from that era?** 

(Or maybe like a respectful cartoonlike tribute version of a band from that era ;)) 

What kind of effects would you use? What kind of ""modern mixing"" stuff would you deliberately ignore? I'm curious about any thought and ideas. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be sure: I doubt they want a scientifically accurate reproduction of an 80s show, so no need to suggest any expensive vintage gear, mixing boards or PA systems :)

If you have specific microphone or FX unit suggestions, I'm open however.

&amp;#x200B;

(I will probably be using an M32 to mix the show, could also be a Pro1/6 maybe)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot

X AIR 16 Disconnects,"I purchased an X Air 16 a year ago because I didn't like the board I was always provided for the only (yearly) gig I run sound for. I did not realize at the time that it was sold to me used by B&amp;H, the open box indication was not obvious. I had nothing but problems with it this weekend. It was on firmware 1.16 (now on 1.17 which appears to be the latest) connected wirelessly in AP mode to an older IPAD 2. At my outdoor gig, it completely stopped working. It seems that it was a network issue but even with the ipad touching the device, the connection couldn't be made. The wireless network was intermittently either visually working with no connection to the mixer, visually available with choosing to connect coming back with a connection error or not even showing up as an available wifi network. At my day job I am an IT manager with a network engineering background and this was no wifi interferance issue. I was out on an island with the device a couple of inches away and the strongest wifi signal I could see was 1-2 bars from the hotel who'se pool I was at.  I am not sure if I have a defective device (someone else returned it after all) or if i kept running into a bug in the software. 

When I was disconnected, it would usually stay disconnected until rebooting the board. I also tried connecting via my phone with no improvement. 

I realized afterwards, based on some forum posts, I should be bringing my own PC as well as wifi router for the IPAD access but I am looking for recommendations going forward. I planned on using the device this upcoming weekend for the second half of the festival and I need to figure out if I should be looking at a warranty return (if possible) or if I need to make changes elsewhere.

Looking to build an A/B/Y multi guitar amp rig using stereo effects pedals for live performances and recording. But am concerned about ground hum. Anyone have suggestions for gizmos that can split a guitar signal without causing phase or hum problems? (+ questions re: micing this multi-amp rig live),"[**LONG POST**]

Sorry if this is a bit too guitar-based of a question to be asked here, but it does concern my hopes to set up a working multi-amp rig for live performance, without causing horrible sounding hum that would annoy an audience. And as much as I love /r/guitar, I feel like all of you brilliant folks here might have more understanding of the technical end of this issue.

I've noticed that various players with really big guitar sounds (like Adam Jones of Tool) have multi-amp setups. Even guys like Zakk Wylde use a chorus pedal with multiple amps to thicken their sound.

At the moment I have a BOSS DD-6 delay with stereo outs and I'm looking to add a BOSS Chorus pedal and BOSS Reverb pedal with stereo outs as well.

**What I'd like to go for is an A/B/Y setup, so I have the option of running two amps simultaneously during live performance.** I actually would even be interested in running three amps simultaneously if possible. (Though this isn't absolutely necessary. If a three-way splitter is insanely expensive compared to a two-way A/B/Y one, I'm fine with sticking to the two-way one. Hauling two amps to a show would probably be enough work as it is.)

---

I've read how on albums like Siamese Dream, multi-tracking/layering guitar parts was a huge part of getting that monstrous tone, which got me thinking that if I rigged up two (or three) amps to use all at once while playing live or while recording, I might be able to sort of approximate that effect.

Adam Jones of Tool uses three amps, with each one focused on handling a different chunk of the frequency range, or configured to create a different tonality:

&gt;So I’ve always played with two or three amps: one for high end, one that’s good with midrange and one that kicks in with the low; or I use one that’s got that good solid-state Metallica crunch and one that’s got that warm Marshall tube sound.

https://www.guitarworld.com/gw-archive/dear-guitar-hero-adam-jones-tool-talks-tone-gear-videos-bands-anonymity-time-between-albums-and-more

Of course in my case, what I'm going for won't be anywhere near the Corgan-esque wall of sound derived from stacking 20 or 30 guitar tracks all at once. But having two amps going at once is still a 100% increase in guitar.

It might also make recording multiple guitar tracks easier, and give me an interesting way to get tonal variety from recording the same guitar parts. I could have two amps going at once, have them both miced up, but have them configured differently so that while I'm playing one guitar part, two different guitar tones would be generated and recorded. And this variation in tone could result from different amp settings, or simply by virtue of using say, a solid state amp alongside a tube amp.

***Question re: splitter box and hum***

I have done some research and it seems that a splitter that eliminates ground hum is vital.

https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Tone_Stacking_With_Two_Amps

https://www.seymourduncan.com/blog/the-tone-garage/multi-amp-rigs-101

But I don't know anything about this kind of gadgets, i.e. what brands make them, what price range they usually fall in, what features to look for, who makes decent ones that aren't crazy expensive, etc. I've never tried to rig up anything this complex.

**Are there any A/B/Y splitter boxes that are of decent/solid quality that effectively eliminate hum issues, without being ultra-expensive? It would be cool to run three amps at once, but if such a box is prohibitively expensive, two amps is fine.**

---

***Question RE: Micing These Amps during live shows and recording***

Also, I was wondering if you guys might have some input on ways to mic these two amps during live shows, and at home.

In my Adam Jones research, I found this information from one of Tool's engineers saying he would use two mics on each of Jones' amps:

&gt;Adam mainly runs three amps: He has a Marshall that he loves, a Diezel and then he was using a Mesa Boogie at one point. I brought in a Bogner Uberschall head and a Rivera Knucklehead Reverb, and several other things. Then we just experimented with combinations of heads and cabinets until it worked for the song. Most of the 4×12s were Mesa Boogie cabinets, which are superior for their low end, except for the Marshall head, which went through a Marshall cabinet, and the Rivera went through a Rivera cabinet. I usually used stock miking. For me, that's a Shure SM57 and a Sennheiser 421 on every cabinet. The third mic could be anything that I felt the sound needed more of.

https://www.guitarfxdepot.com/rigs/adam-jones-tool-guitar-rig/

**Do you guys similarly recommend a combo mic setup of an SM57 and a Sennheiser 421?** 

At the moment I just have one SM57 and three SM58s, but at some point I might be open to getting other mics.

**What does the 421 do that is different from the SM57? Would it make a difference in my sound while playing live? Or just be too much unnecessary work for the sound guy?**

***Question re: capturing three discrete guitar tracks from three amps simultaneously, in one take***

(This question might be too focused on recording to be included here, so feel free to skip it. I just thought I should include it anyways, since it is the last element I'd need to cover.)

I have a very basic Behringer Xenyx 1204 4 channel mixer with a separate UCA-200 RCA-to-USB interface that goes into my computer. 

**I'd be interested in being able to capture separate tracks simultaneously by individually micing different guitar amps while I play a single take, and running these mic cables into separate channels on a mixer.** 

This interview about Adam Jone's recording technique explains what I mean:

&gt;The signal chain for tracking guitar was a bit complex. “Adam would play into whatever pedals he needed,” Barresi says. “That signal then went into a Systematic Systems Splitter. Then it would go to between three and five heads. The signal from the heads went to their own individual cabinets. Each cabinet had two or three microphones on it. Then all the microphones came back to the console, and they were blended down as separated for each amp. The Diezel amp went to its own track. The Marshall amp went to its own track. The third track was a blend of the Bogner and the Rivera, or whatever I liked for the song. And that would be one take — three tracks of guitar.”

https://www.guitarfxdepot.com/rigs/adam-jones-tool-guitar-rig/

In my case, the problem is that when I run two or three or four mics into my mixer, then out into the separate RCA/USB interface, and into Audacity on my computer, that everything will just get mixed down into one single track.

**Is there any way to have a mixer simultaneously record to multiple discrete tracks on a computer program?** 

Is the issue that my mixer doesn't have a USB output built-in? Would I be able to lay down multiple discrete tracks all at once with a different mixer?

(Again, no worries if people don't want to answer this last question. The other two more directly connect to livesound, whereas this is tied more to recording).

Midas M32 Odd Scenario Help!,"Hey r/livesound!

I work for a church as the tech director and I am trying earnestly to find a solution to a seemingly stupid simple problem. 

For the life of me I cannot figure out how to create a Bus that, as an output ,can follow post-fader with effects, but I can  mute a certain channel.

&amp;#x200B;

Before and after the service we run a Spotify playlist into the board and out the mains, it is muted during the service. Our worship is contemporary so running at about 98db, when the service ends and we turn the Spotify playlist on, it runs around 60-70db in the sanctuary. 

Here is where it is getting complicated... We have a main out running to speakers under a patio area outside with a screen so people can watch the service if they are out there. The problem is that because the outside speakers are being fed from the mains, either Spotify is too quiet to be heard when people are talking out there, or if we turn up the amp for those speakers, then the band is blaring loud when they play. I hope that makes sense...

What I am trying to figure out how to do is have an aux output from the board that follows the sound mixer's moves during the service while mixing the band and also includes the internal board effects we are adding on, but allows me to  mute the Spotify channel. That way I can take our main output into another small board, and bring Spotify in as a second channel to create a separate mix for just outside.

Long context: I was trying to get samples recorded and played back in studio one awhile back and I eventually learned that you can't have samples play back in SampleOne without holding the freaking button. So I turned to ableton, and you can have samples playback with one button press, but my next problem was getting multiple DIFFERENT samples (not transposed from the same dumb sample) on the same ""patch"" (correct me if that's wrong terminology please). I got an iPad because I was told by multiple people I could do what I needed to without a MacBook, then I learn that Mainstage is a Mac only app, so I turn to GarageBand. I cannot find any useful tutorials for the iPad version and assigning  samples to certain ranges on the keyboard or even splitting two different presets on the same keyboard for that matter. I tried KASPAR because in the manual it stated it could do sampling (however somethingsomething LFOs stuff) and it can't sample nor can I seem to get the sampler in garageband to send stuff to KASPAR so I can play it through there.

Best IEM Tx practices,"Hey all,

I am trying to track down intermittent dropouts in my IEM system at a venue. We are using 8 PSM900s in the G50 band, summed through Shure's antenna combiner, then sent to a Shure helical antenna. Tx are all 50mW. Antenna is probably 50' from stage at FOH. Room is a gym with brick walls, and the band is against one of these walls. 6ch of ULXD (also G50) in the venue, and 4ch of ULXD in an adjacent venue. All RF being coordinated with WWB6, and using a zone for each venue. 

We used to get a fair amount of dropouts when the antenna and FOH were firing directly at the band and the wall behind them. Dropouts decreased a bit when FOH and the antenna moved to fire about 45deg at the band and wall. Wondering if I am best off moving the antenna adjacent to the stage firing parallel to the wall behind the band (in an attempt to further reduce multipath interference).

What are your thoughts on using a choir mic instead? Any other potential options? I know this is kinda more of an A/V thing, but the only mics they have to rent are more in the live sound realm so I figured I would post here first.

LCR Suggestions,"I'm in a  400 seat performance arts theater with stadium seating and a rather large apron. My setup is LCR+Sub, Danley SM60F's with a QSC KW181. EV Sx250 L/R front fills on stage. Yamaha LS9-32 console with BSS London Blu-16 processor.

Right now I've got L/R out of my stereo bus and subwoofer out of my mono bus into the processor. I'm summing L/R together into Center. It sounds great, but I'm wondering if this is best for trying to utilize stereo separation, mostly for concerts. Is there a better way I can utilize my Blu16, or should I just give up and use the mono bus as Center and send Sub from a different send? I mentioned my large apron stage because the seats on the far left/right won't necessarily be subjected to the full stereo effect, but I'm not sure if the people in the center will either since I have L/R summed. Any insight into the mixing behind L/C/R, as far as panning left to right?

Also, I know a lot of people are using L/R for instruments and C for vocals only, but I don't think the coverage of my speakers would allow for that. It may be something I play with in the future, if someone really recommends trying it.",t2_7t6iq,1,1

"Concerned about potential for hearing loss as audience member and performer at concerts. Until I'm able to afford a wireless IEM system, is it possible to buy custom ear plugs that block out or quiet the most harmful frequencies/sound levels, while still allowing for adequate listening/monitoring?","[WARNING: LONG POST]

I'm hoping to start a proper band project and start playing bar gigs, but I'm very concerned about the potential for hearing loss.

I attend bar shows on a weekly basis - sometimes twice a week. But the one thing (well, apart from the tendency to get pulled into excessively late nights and too much drinking) that really drives me nuts is the loudness of basically every single concert I attend. 

There's absolutely nothing I can do about this, since every guitarist wants to blast their amps to 11 (which I absolutely understand as a guitarist myself - ego is a hell of a drug). But also because most of these bar spaces are pretty small, and even without the live sound running through the speakers, the sound in that enclosed space is deafening.

**What I'm wondering is if there are custom ear plugs that can be purchased that might allow me to block out the more oppressive sound levels and frequencies to preserve my hearing, yet still allow me to hear enough of what I need to hear.** For enjoyment of concerts, and monitoring myself and my bandmates as a performer playing on stage at these venues later this year.

I have noticed one of the long-term musicians in the scene wearing what appear to be custom-made ear plugs that he has around his neck on a string, that he wears at concerts. I can only presume that they are built in such a way that he can still (almost) fully enjoy the music at shows and hear what he needs to hear, while protecting his hearing.

**Does anyone here have any advice they could give me on such types of ear plugs? I imagine I might need to see an audiologist for these, if they exist. And they will cost in the $100s. But I'm definitely willing to spend, say, $150-$300 on something like this if can potentially preserve my hearing and let me keep playing and listening to music for the rest of my life.**

---

**Questions about custom ear plugs and/or IEMs while performing**

My understanding at the moment is that some sort of wireless IEM system would be the way to go for protecting my ears yet still being able to hear what I need to hear while performing. I do have a pair of Shure SE210s and SE110s, though it looks like it would still cost another $1000 CAD to get the whole wireless monitoring system. Which I can't really afford at the moment.

*Therefore, I'm wondering if the sort of custom ear plugs mentioned above might allow me to protect my hearing while playing live, yet still let enough sound through to adequately monitor things.*

**Though I get that this might not be possible, since IEMs would actually allow sound to come through the earbuds, to let me hear things. Whereas ear plugs would just block out sound.**

Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see if there is some sort of middle ground between doing nothing, and spending $1000+ for a wireless IEM system.

**On that note, since I already do have a couple sets of Shure IEMs, is it at all possible to build some kind of semi-portable WIRED monitoring system that I could use on stage? Maybe involving using a little cheap super basic Behringer-type 1 or 2 channel mixer, that I could have on stage with me, and connect to the IEMs?**

I know the main issue would be with trying to connect my mixer to the 'monitor sends' (?) from the main mixing board at the venue. And of course that might not be practical to run some 150 foot cable from the sound guy's board all the way to the stage for me to use for monitoring.

However:

a) at some local dedicated music venues, they do already seem to have some kind of long cable run (a 'snake'?) linking the stage to the soundboard, where there are some 1/4"" input jacks available for the guitarist to plug their guitars into, that connect to the board. 

b) with these guitar input jacks, there are also long speaker wire runs connecting to some monitor speakers on the stage, that performers use to hear themselves.

*With this kind of setup, would it be theoretically possible to have the 1/4"" inch speaker wire, or maybe a super long 1/4"" audio cable, run from the sound guy's booth, that I could connect into a little cheap mini mixer I have on stage next to me? That I can plug my shure IEMs into?* So I can listen to both myself, and the 'house mix' of all the other instruments in my band, while dialing in my own monitor mix right there on stage?

Also, with this kind of hypothetical setup, could I incorporate some kind of limiter or compressor or noise reducing system, that could protect my ears from any sudden spikes in volume coming from the sound guy's board? Would a guitar noise reducer or compressor pedal work for that? Or would I need something more specialized? 

As bad as loud volumes already are at concerts, I can't imagine anything worse for hearing that a sudden surge in volume or feedback that runs directly through my IEMs into my eardrums. That's a terrifying prospect to consider.

---

There are musician friends I know who are incredibly talented yet quite a bit younger than me, who have already suffered considerable hearing loss. Meanwhile I know there are even some veteran sound guys who have suffered hearing loss significantly, which can't help with their job either...

I was at 3 bar shows in the last week alone, and while I took breaks during the first two, for the last one I toughed it out because I was really into the performers (which is what I've typically done up til now). 

But I regret it already. As soon as I walked outside midway through the last show, my ears felt like they were completely clogged and underwater. And I had mild tinnitus for a good half hour after.

The pain I feel in my ears from the cranked guitars and amps is almost immediate, and I try to sit further back from the stage, though this doesn't do much in small bars. I also try to take regular breaks because I can't stand the veritable onslaught of sound. I'll sometimes feel a bit queasy over how loud things are. Though then I feel bad for leaving the show mid-set, because I don't want the band to think I'm not enjoying the performance.

I apologize for the length of the post, and if I got any of the technical terminology wrong (I'm not a trained sound guy - the most I did was some very basic working of a powered mixed while I was running an open mic/jam night for a couple of years. Though I did learn a lot in that time.)

Thanks for any input you guys and gals might offer.

Playing an automated set with click vs. Stripping back instruments and playing naturally,"I am in a small time local rock/pop band. We are trying to sound more ""produced"" than other bands. That's gonna be our shtick. Incorporating lush effects into our set to sound bigger, also incorporating electronic effects to get people to dance. (competing with DJ scene). 

&amp;#x200B;

We've decided against in ear monitoring and we'll just work with the venue to monitor. So my two ideas are:

A.) Have the drummer wear in ear monitoring to count us in, and the set will be pre-arranged on Ableton, meaning we can have backing tracks and automated effects. i.e. at bar 34, the entire song gets swept into a sea of flanger or at bar 72, a nice synth pad is added to the mix that no one is actually playing, just to add depth.  
B.) We skip the pre-arranged set and just play the best to our ability. 2 keys, 2 guitars, bass, acoustic drums, sampler pad, only 4 person group.

My question with A.) is... are live sound guys cool with having one person not monitored like the rest? And if that's the drummer how does that work? I'm guessing he will miss out on the bass guitar unless he can feel it because that is not going through Ableton, for instance.

I’m very limited with what I have to work with at the moment and I know that’s part of it. I fee like I have to hack channel EQ and Main Graph to bits and still have trouble getting clean stable gain that sounds decent. Like tonight I have to use a Behringer xAir. Have a 58 at a lectern and two small powered speakers (anchor) probably 20+ feet away from the podium and a few feet forward from them. I get the 58 sounding pretty good and stable but ideally I would like more headroom. I can only get a few more dB without it getting a little wild. It’s not incredibly loud. I worked on adding a LAV and neither of the two I had on hand could get stable and still sound good enough to use. There is always something wanted to jump out with more gain.

Wireless Beta87A more bleed than wired Beta 87C?,"I was mixing my church's livestream, and a weird thing I noticed is that the wireless mic has more drum/cymbal bleed than the wired mic. Now what makes this weird is a few things:

2. The wireless mic singer is about 5 feet further away from the drums than the main singer on the wired mic. (Wired microphone in the center, wireless on right and left, drums in the back right corner of the stage, and this wireless in question in in the front left of the stage)

There's a pretty decent difference in bleed, and they are under the same exact processing, and at the same level.

Two Schools of Thought on Soundchecking Monitors.,"I’m curious for  r/livesound’s opinion on this.

When it’s time to get the band’s monitor mix in order, i like to do it with the mains and subs at a good operating volume.

On the other hand, i’ve worked with engineers that swear by having the mains completely off during this time. 

Heard many different thought process on this as well. 

I’m curious what your methods are, and your rational.

Networking/CS knowledge for live sound,"I was lucky enough to get a tour of FOH at a large club yesterday, and their house A1 reiterated something I've heard repeatedly as I've progressed in live sound.


""To troubleshoot this equipment effectively, we need to be networking and programming experts before we need to be audio pros.""


He was referring to a custom built Clair Bros system, integrated Lake EQ and house/bar speaker DSP all layered on top of each other, but the sentiment is true for all but the simplest setups.

How to setup Virtual Soundcheck on SC48,"Hope all you guys are having great gigs.. I wanted to figure out how I need to patch for Virtual Soundcheck. I did a multitrack last night and would like to tweak the mix a bit at the next venue we hit. 

So would I need to unpatch all my inputs coming from STAGE and then patch them from PRO TOOLS? And also do I need to disable direct outs? 

Also, what has your experience been with virtual Soundcheck? Has it helped? Things to looks out for while doing it?

Upgrading some equipment and looking for advice,"I have not invested much into my PA setup for the past 6 years since I got an X32. I don’t do this full time but I enjoy doing sound for bands and friends and I want to upgrade my system so I have more opportunities and flexibility. Here is my current setup:

* Behringer X32 Console
* Behringer XR12 Rackmount Mixer
* Yamaha P5000S Amplifier
* 2x Yamaha S112v 12” Speakers
* 2x Yamaha SM10v 10” speakers
* 16x4 Rapco 100’ Snake

This system has served me well for many years. Those speakers are 20+ years old and they have proven to be incredibly durable workhorses but I know I can do better. Here is what I am looking to get as an upgrade:

* Behringer X32 Rack (to replace the XR12 for small gigs and double as a stage box for the full X32)
* 2x Turbosound IQ12 Mains
* 4x Turbosound IQ10 Monitors

I’m going to do this a piece at a time so my plan is to get a couple IQ10’s and start using them as mains for my weekly open mic gig and eventually get a couple more IQ10’s for monitors and finally the X32 Rack. The X32 Rack will give me more options for smaller gigs (the XR12 only has 4 mic pre’s) and it can act as a stage box for my X32 console eliminating the need for the multicore snake. Then eventually I may add either two more IQ10 or IQ12’s (see below). I can also use Ultranet to connect the speakers which cuts down on cabling and simplifies everything (daisychaining for the win!) I cannot seem to find any tandem Powercon/Cat5 cables so I guess I will have to make my own but that’s not a big deal.

Looking at the specs of the IQ10’s vs the IQ12’s there isn’t all that much difference. I do sound reinforcement mostly for acoustic bands and my current Yamaha speakers have never failed to play loud enough. The IQ10’s play louder and lower than my current 12” speakers. My current speakers are rated down to only 60hz (-10db!) and have a max SPL of 125db while the IQ10’s go to 55hz (-3db) with 129db max SPL. That is a significant difference. Do I even need to bother with the IQ12’s? I occasionally do rock bands and my Yamahas have proven to be fine in those situations as well. Again, the IQ10’s are louder and play lower so I don’t know if the IQ12’s would be worth the extra cost and weight.

* IQ10 Specs: [https://media.music-group.com/media/PLM/data/docs/P0APK/TURBOSOUND\_iQ10%20P0APK\_Product%20Information%20Document.pdf](https://media.music-group.com/media/PLM/data/docs/P0APK/TURBOSOUND_iQ10%20P0APK_Product%20Information%20Document.pdf)
* IQ12 Specs: r/[https://media.music-group.com/media/PLM/data/docs/P0APL/TURBOSOUND\_iQ12%20P0APL\_Product%20Information%20Document.pdf](https://media.music-group.com/media/PLM/data/docs/P0APL/TURBOSOUND_iQ12%20P0APL_Product%20Information%20Document.pdf)

So if I upgrade to powered speakers I will have that Yamaha amp lying around that I won’t need anymore. I want to get some subs eventually and I was looking at active options but then I remembered that I will have that P5000S that could easily power a pair of subs. What is a good passive sub? I could get a pair of Yamaha SW118V’s for about $1000 which is the price of a single Turbosound IQ18B. I don’t do that many shows where I would need subs. Are the Yamaha subs decent or are there better passive options in that price range?",t2_x6bg2,1,1

"I have a home studio, and solid recording equipment... but that’s not useful for live audio, right?","I’ve built up a nice home studio with two solid and reliable mics, I have loads of software plugins, and have songs mixed.

But... those recording mics (condenser) those software plugins, it’s all fairly useless in a live setting right?

In a live audio setting, how much software do you guys actually use, and do you use third part plugins (which would likely introduce latency), or do you stick almost entirely to hardware?

What are the essentials for a recording artist to understand, and can anything aside from basic cables be brought into a live setting?

Unhappy with AV so far - are there any other careers in live sound that are more fulfilling and have similar demand?,"I graduated college with a degree in Communications focusing in music production and audio engineering in 2016. Early 2017 I interned at an audio mastering and restoration studio and from the first half of 2017 to the end of June 2018 I stacked boxes in trucks at Amazon 10-12 hours per day (no other job prospects).



I interviewed in early spring with a big AV company who seemed interested and then didn't give me the job because the only work I'd done was studio work and some rigging. 



I started with my current company July 2nd. It was really new and exciting for a couple weeks, then the lead technician quit and left me with the only other tech. He can setup equipment really quick but it can take him 3-4 times as long as I do to scan an order and fill it or receive it. He's an older guy, and doesn't know much about computers of PowerPoint - so I'm stuck dealing with all of that bullshit before presentations. 



Our biggest account had us come to a hotel and run a conference. The sales and banquet staff didn't look at the setup diagrams and moved his tables from where they were supposed to be and he chewed me out for it. He was upset people's YouTube videos wouldn't automatically play... they won't in the most recent version of PowerPoint. I converted the videos I could to mpeg and set them to automatically play, but one was too large and had choppy playback even when I compressed it. That presenter HAD to use presenter view and you can't click play on YouTube videos in presenter view. 



I stayed 2 and 1/2 hours past when I was scheduled to try to come to a solution and all I could do was switch to slideshow mode when she came to that slide. That account wrote my boss a nasty email saying she had given her presentation all over the nation and the YouTube video played automatically when she gave it anywhere else. 



Last week I setup for a group with two presenters - one of them had been a surgeon for 30 years. He was giving a deep presentation on the connection between war, robotics, and surgery. He came up and said, ""Can we go through my presentation? I don't have a computer anymore I just make PowerPoints on my iPad."" They had only paid my company for a tech to be there till start, and it was about 15 minutes till he was supposed to start. The guy had all his text in Comic Sans and had 20 videos on his thumb drive that he didn't embed in the presentation (they were all supposed to be in a slide and start automatically). He said, ""Oh, I thought when I downloaded a video to my thumb drive it would just add a slide on my PowerPoint."" 


I got him situated and then my boss calls and says they messed up an invoice and I need to run a rental across town that the client needed yesterday... the guy asked me to stay and basically baby him through his presentation and I got the hell out of there. 


That brings me to this morning. I setup for a presenter and his sponsor groups at a ritzy club in the more affluent part of the city. They had one lav mic on the order and a cheap mackie mixer patched to their house speakers, including some video accessories to get a laptop to their projector and some 50 inch monitor displays. 



The presenter had mailed the venue a flash drive with his PowerPoint in advance, so I loaded it up and saw he had a video embedded in it but didn't have the actual file on the drive the event staff and his sponsors kept pestering me and asking what I could do and I kept trying to break it to them that he didn't have the file and it wasn't a video available online somewhere. 



The presenter changed his presentation around to accommodate this, but then came more bull shit. The master of ceremonies came up to my 5 minutes before start and complained that the venue's wireless mic wasn't working and said, ""How does this even happen?"" I got it working, then when the main presenter came up with a lav he went from 0-100 speech level within a moments notice and I kept trying to duck him. The master of ceremonies told me no one could hear him and that I needed to push him up... so of course he kept feeding back. I only had a cheap mackie board with 3 band EQ's and couldn't really cut anything to push the system up any louder... so of course he started feeding back. Then he got to a blank slide with his name and logo on it and asked me if there was a problem with his clicker... No, there is not. Have you gone over your presentation? Advance to the next slide. 



The snooty folks who sponsored the event apologized to me for being snotty and throwing so many wrenches at me and asked if I was OK and even said they'd call us again, but someone still emailed my boss a really nasty complaint. 



I don't know how long I want to stay in this at this point... I was excited to start doing some live sound and video, but I'm literally a roadie for presenters who don't know how to use PowerPoint and haven't prepared their presentations. I'm Microsoft PowerPoint Tech Support at this point, and even when I try my best it results in complaints. 



Does AV get anymore fulfilling? A friend of mine is a stagehand for theatre companies and it seemed like a good gig but he works 80 hours a week or so and drive a box truck or semi all over the US. 



I just wanna find a way to work my way up to doing front of house for someone. 



Are there any other immediately accessible careers in AV that aren't as demeaning and are actually more audio and video based instead of Microsoft PowerPoint? 


Any other advice for me? I'm gonna stay here until I find something else - stacking boxes in trucks 10-12 hours a day for a year taught me how good I have it right now. 



Thanks fellas! ",t2_x1deb,3,1
Advice on buying a new set of microphones + my experiences.,"So i work both in livesound and in a studio and i'm currently investing in my first set of microphones.

I borrowed a few small diaphragm condensers and personaly A/B tested them,

but all of my other assumptions are made based on a big bunch of youtube A/B comparisons between mics so

before i buy i would like to hear if you would agree with what i heard.

Please read my descriptions of the mics i'm interested in and just comment do you hear what i hear, or you heard something different from these mics.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Condensers (overhead mics primarily)

So from a friend i got an offer to buy a stereo pair of SE electronics S1A microphones for an amazing price. Less then 100 dollars a pair.

I also borrowed a sennheiser E614, an AKG C430 and an audio technica ATH450.

The ATH is 200 euros each, E614 anc C430 and 100 euros each and the S1A are obviously by far the cheapest.

My personal testing showed that the E614 has the flattest response and the most natural sound. It has a slight midrange bump but i would pick it over the others for capturing the entire kit or an instrument like an acoustic guitar/violin.

The C430 wasn't very natural, there is a weird midrange bump. Didn't like it.

The ATH was a bit more open sounding then the E614. Less midrange, more ""air"", but it costs twice as much and i don't think it's worth the difference.

The S1A have a slight boost above 8k and are flat below 8k. Which to me seemed like they are amazing as overhead mics since i get a great cymbal sound from them. And i can add the midrange and definition from the closemics.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering the price of the used S1A's. My plan was to buy them instead of the other options. I would later add another pair of more midrangy condenders to the mic bag.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Kickdrum mics.

Long story short. I don't like the ""relatively flat"" response of the mics like the AKG D112 and the EV RE-20. I know they are more natural but that's usually not what i'm looking for with kickdrum sounds and they make me EQ a lot.

The beta 52 and the audix D6 for my taste are a one trick pony. They both have an overly agressive curve that can be great for metal, but whenever i want anything a bit more ""rock sound"" and more natural, their boosts and scoops are simply too much and i can't fix that with an EQ.

&amp;#x200B;

The sennheiser E602 II was a winner for me here. It also has a pre EQ curve that boost sub frequencies and the beater sound. But it's more natural and not as agresive. Plus there is no sharp 5K bump like with the beta 52. I can get the 2-3k ""smack"" from it that i can't get from a 52 because it only gives me the ""click"" and makes the kickdrum sound a bit like a black metal trigger.

The newer E902 has a flatter curve that i would like for a bass amp, but not for a kickdrum.

&amp;#x200B;

So i was going to but an E602 II. What do you think about what i heard?

&amp;#x200B;

3. Toms

The MD421 is to expensive and not very functional for live use. I like both the E604 and the E904 from the tests i heard and from my experiences. But, i'm not very certain that the E904 can be called an overall better microphone. It's just different. It cleans up highmids compared to the e604 because it has a more broad hi-mid boost. But it takes away more of the below 100HZ material and makes lower tuned floortoms sound empty.

In short, i don't think the e904 is better, i think it's different. And for toms, it seems to me i would in many cases prefer the 604 to the 904. But i like the metal build of the e904 and sometimes i can use the extra 5k click i get from the 904. (snare and smaller toms).

&amp;#x200B;

I can't make a decision here... need advice. I would buy 3 tom mics.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Guitars.

57

So 57 is a classic, a huge hi-mid boost that adds definition to the guitar and that can sometimes be great. So i will have one in my bag.

Beyer M201TG

The complete contrast to the 57 which i still consider amazing for the guitar is the beyerdynamic M201TG. Much flatter curve, slight mid boost at 2-3k. Rich lowmids.

I love it. I would use it when a want a warmer tone that's not going to be ear piercing and overly defined.

SENN E906

The best balance between the two.

So unlike the beyer which is quiet flat, the 906 has a midrange bump. But at about 3-4k and it's a lot milder then the 57.

So it adds definition to the guitar, but it doesn't cover up the ""around 2k"" midrange by boosting 5-6k a thousand dB like a 57. It seems to me to be the best option when the guitar amp sounds amazing and i don't want to alter it's sound.

&amp;#x200B;

I would now buy the e906 and later a 57 + the beyer. It seems to me i can cover all bases with there 3 very different microphones.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Vocals.

58:

Let's take the 58 as a standard and compare to it.

Sennheiser e835

Seems to be ""on pair"" with a 58. Slightly different curve. Better for some vocals, worse for some other vocals.

Sennheiser E935

Damn amazing, more defined and natural mids then a 58. Worth the 200 euros pricetag. Fantastic overall balance.

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning on buying a e835 ""3 pack"" or some 58's cheap. Both seem good. And buy one e945 for fancy concerts since i wouldn't give it to a punk singer.

Folk Band Woes,"First off, mixing this genre is new to me. I’ve been working with a band that have 2 acoustic guitars, mandolin, dobro, upright bass, and 3 vocalists. They’re used to all crowding around one condenser mic and playing the mic to perform. No pickups. This obviously limits control for individual instruments and is a feedback machine. Last night we tried pickups on the two acoustic guitars an individual vocal mics. They weren’t fans of the setup, they felt it wasn’t like they were performing as one like when they all crowd around the condenser. Of course, they also want it to be loud enough in the monitor so everyone can hear everything personally. I think next time I’ll try to get everyone on pickups and do a couple 57’s in an XY config on one stand so they can still feel like they’re around the mic. Is this a good approach? Any suggestions are welcome!",t2_10w6h8,1,1

X32 Producer: S32 or X32 Rack and SD16,"Hi guys,

I'm a (amateur) sound tech for a live band with 7 musicians. We have a setup with an Behringer X32 Producer, a Behringer SD16 digital snake and a 16 ch analog snake. We're looking into getting rid of the analog snake. Our total input channel usage is about 24 channels. All musicians have their on IEMs with a separate mix. 

I've looked into a few options and narrowed it down to 2 options which are (almost) identical in price (around 700-750 EUR): an S32 snake or an X32 Rack. The S32 is the logical/normal choice for my scenario, but hear me out. 
Every musician in the band has his own IEMs. Currently, they run of our X32 Producer which means they all get a mono mix. With the X32 Rack I could use that as a monitor mixer AND route the additional inputs to the X32 Producer (and route the SD16 inputs into both consoles as well). Effectively having 32 input on stage (16 on the Rack, 16 on the SD-16) and at FoH. This way they could all have stereo mixes and I would free up 7 busses on my FOH console.

From what I've read stereo mixes are a big plus, but I would like to know if I'm missing something or if there might be another reason NOT to go the X32 Rack + X32 Producer + SD16 route. The only downsides I currently see is the initial setup will be a bit harder (routing wise) and possibly having different EQ and dynamics on the IEM mixes (which might not even be a bad thing?). As the X32 Rack can be controlled through the Q-app by the musicians themselves and by me through the full app, control over the IEMs is not an issue. ",t2_129ixh,2,1
Mic'ing A Choir On A Football Field With A 300-Person Marching Band Behind Them,"Hello r/livesound!

Title says it all. I'm struggling to come up with the best way to do this as there are currently two schools of thought on my team and I thought I'd get a third opinion.

This Saturday, my college marching band has one of our choirs joining us on field for out halftime show and we really aren't sure the best way to mic them. They'll be standing in several tight arcs no more than 10 yards across one the front sideline with a third of the band to their left and right and the last third (mostly trumpets and the drumline) behind them. My biggest concern is blocking the sound of the band and the drumline from behind them.

My initial idea was to put two or three small diagraph mics in front of them. This way, we could use their bodies as a shield to absorb as much of the sound as possible from behind them. Downside is that we won't catch as many people in the back. The second idea is to use two booms hanging over them pointed down. But the closest thing my department has to a boom mic is the Shure SM57. Is that directional enough to not pick up sound coming from the band behind? And I guess the third idea a priori is some combination of both.

Any insight on this? This is my first time mic'ing a choir and the challenge of finding something that works in a live setting with a marching band behind them is really throwing me off, so any insight would be appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Post game update:

&amp;#x200B;

We had our rehearsal Friday with the choir and our biggest issue was feedback. We initially had 4 57s out but cut it down to 2 after the feedback issues. Their final position was a little below chest height pointed ever so slightly upwards. There were no problems when the band was playing quietly, but as soon as they started to step on the gas we were hitting major feedback very quickly. We pinpointed the feedback to (surprise) the drumline and specifically bass 3 was tuned to the same pitch that kept amplifying itself. So we took that bass out of the show and EQ'd out as much of the bass as possible on our mixer.

Overall, everything worked. There were only a couple moments during the show feedback started to creep in, but we kept it all under control. Looking back, I really wish I had a drum shield (will probably make this investment the next time we have a choir) and an equalizer. I've been looking at the Behringer FBQ3102HD Graphic Equalizer anyways so we'll probably add this to our arsenal soon. Thank you all for your help and suggestions!",t2_132ty1,39,1
using the behringer x32 SD16 by itself.... literally.,"I'm a musician, with a lot of experience in analog mixing and no experience with digital mixing. I played a concert Monday and the sound engineer needed help setting up his rig. I was helping him run cables to his SD16 in a rack and he was controlling and mixing everything through his ipad and his macbook. It made me wonder, is this possible all the time, technically you don't even need a console to have live sound, you just need this digital snake and a macbook? does the macbook and ipad app require a license key when you buy an x32 or what? I know this is probably a dumb post to make but the digital sound world is new to me. 

Continuing (assuming my question is correct), is the digital snake pre powered so it doesn't even need amps either? or would it still need amps?

Dante Controller on Mac issues,"Hey guys and girls!

So to start, i've never had an issue using Dante Controller on a PC, seems to be plug and play. However, lately when i've tried using my Macbook Pro, it won't show me the Dante network, at all.. I see the network in the Network section of Preferences, but Dante Controller doesn't show the network.

I should note, that when I use Shure WWB6, the receiver network appears instantly, and I have not issues with hard line internet.

Im running a 2018 Macbook Pro 15"" with High Sierra, and the latest version of Dante Controller.

What am I missing here? It's gotta be so damn simple.

Many thanks in advance!!!

UPDATE:

I've figured it out, and feel stupid as hell... The hub I have works perfectly fine. After checking all the settings within the mac and Dante Network settings, it occurred to me that I didn't check the ""Configure Dante Interfaces"" window. Which showed the ""en5"" port as default and not the ""en7"" (which is the external ethernet hub) as default, whereas my experience on PC is that it automatically allocates that port.

Used it tonight and it worked really well. I appreciate all the advice in this thread, it ended up helping me snoop out the issue.
