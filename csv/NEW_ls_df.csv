Wireless Router/Mobile App for A&amp;H Qu/SQ-series,"Just looking for a quick tip regarding buying wireless routers for the mixers I work a lot on!

Can I just buy whatever, or is there something I should watch out for? I've heard good things about Allen &amp; Heaths app, and I find myself doing gigs where I get stowed away in a trap-corner (so to speak) more often, so it would be extremely convenient to just adjust EQ while walking around the room on my phone, instead of backtracking to the mixer everytime I need to do a quick change.

Any experiences with the app or similar things you can share?",t2_15vujp,2

Question - Can I cover the back of my LDC for live use?,"I'm playing a few tunes at a small holiday gathering on Thurs.  I want to mic my vocals and guitar but will also play with a violinist, and a vocalist. (Will be different personnel for different tunes) Would love to have one mic cover us all for ease of set up..plus it'll be in a small, private room... not a club.  

Can I just use my AT4040 LDC mic and cover the back of it with some foam/cardboard so it doesn't pick up extraneous room noise?

Could also use a couple of SDCs (Rode NT5s).

Sad Shure SM81 - Any ideas?,"Hey /r/livesound, been a bit since I've posted.

Recommendations for budget tops and subs,"Hey all! I'm in a smaller bar band and looking for recommendations for 2 mains and 2 subs.

Between the Lines #5 - The Real World,"Hello, all.

Today's post comes to you from a 600 seat concert hall in upstate NY. The hall was originally constructed for acoustic performances, and as such is far more reverberant than we'd like for reinforced music. The seating is covered by what some of my system tech buddies jokingly call a ""dash"" array - that is, a 'line array' that's too short to exhibit any meaningful line source behavior at any frequency. Specifically, four boxes per side, which is barely enough to cover the seating area. What's more, they're all driven off a single DSP channel per side, so optimization options are few.

Since this is the type of situation that we are very likely to encounter often in the real world, I thought it might be illustrative to show what ""should"" be done in this situations vs what *can* be done.

[Here](https://imgur.com/lnmdewq) we see the house left array response over the seating area, with mic positions at the ONAX of each box in the array. [Here is an alternate view](https://imgur.com/UDDmC3H) of the same data with 1/12 oct smoothing, thicker traces, and the coherence trace visible for position ONAX A (top box, back rows). The subwoofer is muted. A lot of working with an analyzer is displaying the data in a format that's comfortable for you to parse and understand. I tend to prefer less smoothing and thin traces, but when writing or presenting I use more smoothing and thicker traces just to make the trends a little easier to see for people who may not spend all day staring at analyzers.

(EDIT: [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/a6rkp9/between_the_lines_5_the_real_world/ebz9exb) about using trace averaging is very important here. I'm not looking for trends, I'm looking to see the difference over the space. Trace averaging would completely hide the issue that is the basis of work in this post. It's a ""video solution to an audio problem."" I don't want to make the traces look better (otherwise I'd use Photoshop), I want to solve the problem that makes them look that way.)

The pink trace (ONAX A) is below the level of the others from 250 on up, and much lower above 6k3 or so. This, coupled with the relatively low coherence from being that far back in a reflective room, translates to poor intelligibility for the folks in the furthest seats who need it most. What are the textbook solutions?

**Solution 1**: More boxes. This is out, at least without a lot of budget and advanced notice: it's a permanent install, and the rigging is a deadhang so we can't easily bring the array in. We'd need to bring in motors and a rigger.

**Solution 2**: Close up the angles between the top few boxes. Besides the same logistical issues (can't bring the array down, can't pull pins out from a lift with the array hanging), we're out of coverage angle. The bottom two boxes are already at maximum splay, so by closing up the top, we'll be creating a coverage issue at the bottom. Perhaps this is preferable because front fills could be added, but they can't stay on the deck, so for most events they won't be added because people are lazy, and so we still haven't solved the problem. As an added bonus, this particular model of box has particularly course options for splay angle, and the next choice is too narrow for this application.

**Solution 3:** DSP. Tweak the gain and HF shelf on the top box. Except we can't, because we're all on one channel here. Or can we?

These active boxes have a pot on the back that sets the input level to the internal amp. We can tweak that to get some gain back. There's also a per-box option for HF compensation, and we can try our luck with that to see if we can get an HF shelf boost out of it.

As soon as we talk about level shading arrays, audio people get really nervous. The first issue is that once the array is level-shaded, some boxes are going to go into limiting before others. Whether or not this is a problem is heavily dependent on the situation. Typical shading situations involve bringing the bottom few boxes down by a few dB to reduce the extra HF down front. We try to do as much as we can with splay, but generally we still will need a few dB via gain, and this isn't really an issue of limiting because these boxes, in being turned down, now have \*more\* headroom than those pointing at FOH, so there's no problem. It's when the higher gain boxes are further back in the house, like this example, that we need to be more careful. By setting the gain higher on the top box than for the rest, we have a situation where the top box will hit its limter first and the FOH engineer down in the middle of the house won't hear it. If this is a high-SPL situation (rap, rock, EDM, etc) where the PA is taken to its limits every night (giggity), this is probably something we want to avoid.

However, this is a situation that prioritizes low variance and high intelligibility, and the PA is not operated anywhere even close to its limits. For the types of events staged in this hall, people would be lodging loudness complaints (it's lots of old people, okay?) far before the PA hits its maximum output, so the dynamic range issue isn't a concern, whereas creating a low-variance, high-intelligibility environment for the patrons is definitely a priority for the venue's management.

The other, more common, and far more baseless objection to array shading is that any gain offset between boxes ""breaks the line."" Bob McCarthy has written what I consider to be a [landmark article](https://www.prosoundweb.com/channels/study_hall/breaking_the_line/) about this which outlines a number of reasons why this concern is unfounded, but I'll address the most commonly stated objection here: that shading down some boxes reduces the array's headroom.

Of course this is true, but in reality the loss is so tiny that it's negligible in all but the most extreme situations. We're talking of course about LF because that's where the boxes have the most overlap and thus the most summation. We have a 4 box array, which means that the LF headroom of the array is 12 dB above that of a single box. That is, 0 dB + 0 dB + 0 dB + 0 dB, which *everyone knows* is 12 dB. No? Here's the same math in linear for for boxes at unity:

    1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Get back to log with

     20log(4/1) = 12 dB

Now let's say we turned one box down by 2 dB. How much LF coupling do we lose?

\-2 dB is about .8 in linear (you've got these memorized, [right](http://gph.is/1TqiIcG)?)

So we now have

    0 dB + 0 dB + 0 dB + (-2 dB)

which in linear is

    1 + 1 + 1 + 0.8 = 3.8

That comes out to 11.6 dB rather than 12. (20log3.8 = 11.6, or use 20log(3.8/4) to get the dB loss in relative terms as compared to the no-shading situation)

In a situation that demands low variance, a half a dB in LF headroom is a small price to pay for reducing front-back variance by 2 dB. For the same reason, I'm not concerned about goosing the top box by a dB or two.

Also for the same reason, bringing up the gain on the top box (or down on the rest, if you like) isn't going to cause a significant effect at LF, where all the boxes are working together. It will, however, help increasingly above 1k, which is where our problem is. With one ""pot notch"" (whatever that is) of gain and the HF ""coupling compensation"" onboard DSP filter engaged, here's what we get:

[https://imgur.com/eBkQ5qd](https://imgur.com/eBkQ5qd)

&amp;#x200B;

If you compare that to the [first image](https://imgur.com/lnmdewq), you can see that we actually overshot a bit: the back seats are leading the rest of the array in the HF by about 3 db above 1 kHz. Given those two options, I certainly choose the latter. The intelligibility in the rear is greatly improved over the original state. In addition, I'll take an extra dB or two in the back simply because of the stage sound down front. What we have here is a PA that does not get louder as you get closer to it, and a high degree of confidence that whatever the FOH engineer mixes will be heard in all the seats, which those with touring experience can confirm is a relative rarity in venues of this size. Even with limited options on the table, a small change here and there goes a long way.

As always, comments, questions, and alternate approaches are welcomed. Wishing you all a wonderful holiday season.

Community Theater rig... looking for ideas,"I've put together a small rig for the community theater here and am looking for ideas on ways to improve it.

&amp;#x200B;

1. X-Air XR18
2. 7x Shure Dual wireless Mic packs
3. DriveRack 360 (with RTA mic)
4. Laptop - usually my macbook air soon to add a PC for others to use.
5. Scarlett 2i2 USB DAC (normally stolen from my desk)
6. Stream Deck - surprisingly awesome for shows.
7. In the main venue, I've added some Shure hanging Lavs
8. My spare mixer - Bheringer X1222USB
9. Wireless router since the x-air built-in is a bit lame
10. X-Touch
11. Fire 10 tablet, Fire 7 tablet, phone, whatever is handy to run around the theater with. The 10 is my goto for tuning.
12. LED strip light with a dimmer on a 1x2 that I run across the entire sound table. Goosenecks be gone.
13. (Usually) Yamaha DBR12s for stage monitors. Small Bheringer for backstage monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

The X-Air is a great rig, but I have to admit that I'm considering getting them an X32. When I spec'd the 18, I never envisioned needing 14 friggin wireless mics. They still end up swapping packs around.

So a surprise entry here is the Stream Deck. I honestly bought this on a whim for my gaming rig. Helping out for one show I brought it along. It turns out that the thing is fantastic for audio cues. I'm even tempted to run one over to the director so they can kick off sound effects. Each clip is assigned a button and you can quickly build multiple screens. For the last show there were 45 audio cues. We were able to nail them all easily with the stream deck.

The hanging Lavs have saved us more times than I can count. Unfortunately there's a projector setup in center stage and I can't hang mics there.

I have mics, mixer and driverack mounted in an odyssey FZ1004 10u/4u slant case. It's really heavy despite being loaded with relatively lightweight gear. (And a pair of furman power strips to plug everything in.) Is there a good lightweight option? Setup is much easier despite the weight. Usually it's just a matter of hijacking some cables to run monitor/stage feeds (I use the house wiring and couplers to reverse the xlr flow) and I takeover the master output from the house board. (The house board has some issues so I avoid slaving into it anymore)

&amp;#x200B;

Things I'd love suggestions on:

Lightweight rack options. The case I've been using is a bit painful to haul around. I may just put casters on it and call it a day.

Good ways to extend the X-touch for live shows. The sliders are great but without some midi software controls the buttons on the right are just pretty lights. It seems that I can dual use it as x-air control and then pull midi data via the usb interface at the same time...

Good ways to general Mic center stage. I've considered 1-2 crown PCC-160s or maybe some stand mounted 'choir' mics - aka Lavs on a stick. The idea is to get a bit more pickup for small roles or help out when main characters have mic issues.",t2_14abh6,1

Anyway! As I mentioned in the title,  I think I've broken the drivers in my PA speaker cabs. These speaker cabs I bought second hand, the brand is ""NetSound"" (whoever that are) and the model is a ""BB-B15"". I also bought the powered mixer from the same bloke, he has used these speakers with this mixer for years and has never had an issue, I've posted a link below of some photos of the gear I'm talking about. Anyway, I was jamming with the band the other day and both speakers just stopped, no bang, no smoke, just stopped. I thought it might have been the amp but the interface it was plugged into was still receiving signal so it has to be the speakers .. Both speakers are the same, 8 OHM with a rated output of 400 watts. The mixer has a minimum 4 OHM output and is rated for 250 watts, so it would be impossible to overload these speakers on this amp, right? .. Right? I've tried the same speakers on a different amp and still had no sound come though the speakers. Checked all cables and no worries there, next I opened up the speakers and tested continuity between the input of the speaker and where the wires attach to the 15"" drivers, that was all fine too. the speaker cones move free and aren't scratchy at all, the also don't have any tears or dents in them.. I'm at a loss, I need these things running ASAP. It was only running at around 50% load when they failed. Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Frustrated with loudness complaints,"I have been working at this venue every weekend for about 7 months, it’s inside a casino with a bar placed in the middle front of the room.

For my live shows, I intend to take the various IEM feeds from FOH and plug them all into the XR-18. Then, each aux out will go to a performer. It might seem like an extra step but I believe it's justified - FOH doesn't have to solve any puzzles of getting a feed to everyone across the stage, and people can share monitor mixes if there aren't enough auxes. (Happens a lot, sadly.)

Where I get stuck is how I should set levels for these incoming feeds. There are so many places where the volume is potentially affected:

1. How much FOH puts in their aux send

2. How much gain there is on the channel that feed is going into in the XR-18

3. The channel fader level in the XR-18

4. The aux mix fader level in the XR-18 

5. The input gain on the wireless IEM system's transmitter

6. The volume control on the receiver

That's a lot of steps! I want to make sure, assuming FOH sends a strong signal with no clipping, that I can retain that strength all the way to the band's IEMs. Any advice would be most appreciated :)",t2_4g0ide,2
Best Mic for Quiet Vocalist?,"Hey everyone, i'm wondering what mics have worked best for a quiet vocalist in a loud band. The singer in my band has a very soft voice with a lot of reverb on it. We recently switched her to a IEM setup which has helped a ton with stage feedback issues. The issue we are facing now is cymbal bleed into the mic. We are mostly playing small club size stages so regardless of the vocal placement it's always relatively close to the drums. Our tech last night said that the vocal reverb was hitting the drums super hard and also the drums were bleeding into the IEM mix a lot.  


I know some sort of hyper cardioid pickup mic would work best but i'm wondering what experience people have with each one. We have used a Beta 57 time to time but have found the output too hot and highs a little harsh.

IEMs with Orchestra,"Hey all,

Got a show coming up where I'll be doing some IEM work for a few performers who are being accompanied by a small orchestra and choir. There will be main orchestra mic arrays (probably spaced pair and some outriggers), and spot mics buried within the orchestra.

Usually for orchestral mixes I will delay spot mics to the main array. I'm concerned this technique won't translate to IEMs because of the positioning of the performers with IEMs (likely somewhere nestled around/in the orchestra/choir), and the potential for the performer's voice/instrument to bleed into the spot mics that are close to them. These performers also have a tendency to only wear one ear of their IEM as well. 


How would you monitor engineers attack this? Ditch trying to use the orchestral spot mics at all? Use them but with no delay? Ditch trying to incorporate the main array? ",t2_6cbc7,3

Router recommendation for XR18,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am am music teacher at an elementary school and we put on musicals each year. As the main sound person, I've been slowly improving our sound situation and at the recommendation of some sound tech friends (and due to budget), I went with the XR18. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight was the first show for parents. All week it had been working fine, though like an idiot I was just connected directly to the unit without a router. And of course, like all the posts and reviews say, tonight about 10 minutes after opening house and the room filling up, connection was lost. Even standing right next to it we couldn't get connected. Not with PC or ipad. Had to scramble but made things work. We have our second show tomorrow night. 

&amp;#x200B;

So tomorrow I get to buy what I need for the show that night. Can you guys tell me of some appropriate routers I can get at my local Best Buy that will work fine in a cafeteria of 300 people.  Hopefully not break the bank too much but PTA should reimburse me some. I'm also an idiot and couldn't get it hard wired, but if getting 200 ft of cat-5 or cat-6 will be a good backup plan I will do that as well.

Looking for advice on a setup for a live perfomance in a not so great environment,"Hey guys!

&amp;#x200B;

I was tasked with setting up the gear for a live gig my band is going to do. 

The problem is that we're gonna play in the front of one of our friend's house, in a little recess in front of the garage door.

Our band has three vocals (one main, two backing), eletric guitar and keys (or two guitars, the keyboardist plays rhythm guitar in a couple of songs), bass and drums. 

We have three 150w PA's (connect to the mixer), two 100w guitar amps (both with stands) and one 80w bass amp.

Even though we will have the walls on the sides and back, I'm worried that the open sky and also the front will make everything sound thin and small.

How can I setup this gear so we can have the most presence and compete with the cars passing on the street?

Weird Freespeak II beltpack issue,"I'm currently A2-ing a show right now: I have 7 beltpacks and 1 freespeak II base station. Everything has been working as it should, except I had one beltpack that I could assign roles, but audio would not pass through the headset, no talk, no listen. I could call the channels, and receive calls, but no audio . I changed headsets with a known working set and still no audio.

I went into the menus on a working beltpack and found that the Auto Detect function was off. Changing this to off on the non working beltpack (it was ON) fixed the issue. Turning Auto Detect on my working pack to ON, and then cycling the power, made the belt pack not pass audio.

Has anyone encountered this?! I called tech support to ask about it, thinking there was a way to factory reset the beltpack, but was told that it could not be done, and that the beltpack receives all of its information from the ROLE. But upon looking at the role, there is no selection for Auto Detect.",t2_kqwfn,3
How do I practice?,"I've been fortunate in the past to work with a band that had a kick ass practice space where I could do a full show setup using all the equipment we'd usually use at shows, but due to ""issues"" we've had to move to a much smaller shared space. In this space, the band I work with isn't the main band using the place, so I'm unable to use our normal setup or board, or make any major changes to the board or PA.  It's an older analog board, so I don't have the benefit of scenes or anything. We basically only run vocals through it.

The old setup allowed me to play around with the board and try things without the risk of ruining a live show. I learn best by actually putting my fingers on knobs and sliders, so this is pretty important to me. Ever since moving to the new studio I feel like my skills have stagnated. 

I'm pretty green, but I'm at the point where I can consistently get sound that's ""non broken"" (can hear everyone, no/little feedback etc) but I know I can get things to sound a lot better.  

I also have several live shows recorded. Unfortunately, theres not a lot I can do with those other than loading them up in a DAW and trying to get a good mix out of them. That's valuable for playing with things like EQ, compression, effects etc, but not really comparable to a live show.

What else should I be looking at practice-wise? I suspect I was spoiled before with our old setup. I really wish I had tried more things while we were still there.

Speaker recommendations for a jazz venue,"Hey all, looking for some recommendations for a PA system for the venue I manage.

We're a 1200sq ft, [extremely oddly shaped room](https://imgur.com/a/nJSbFML). Our venue exclusively presents jazz, mostly modern stuff. Since the room is small enough, the acoustic level of the drums really dictates what we throw in the PA, which is usually piano and voice, and occasionally horns that aren't way too loud. Our room is sort of treated so there isn't stuff bouncing around all over the place, but definitely still a live + kind of boomy room. 

Our current system is a pair of Mackie SA1530z. The issue I encounter is how the sound of the room changes based on where you're sitting. In the middle area of the room, up to where the mixer is, there's a raised roof that goes up about 24 feet. The room is at it's regular height at the stage and behind the mixer, which is 14 feet. As you might guess, the change in roof size affect the sound and things sound different on stage, vs right in front of the stage, vs, all the way behind the mixer. Additionally, the room also gets tinier (as in like an L shape), so you really don't get much of the stage right speaker in the back of the room. 

My first thought is that the Mackies are raised at the 14 feet height of the ceiling, so hanging at about 11-12 feet, and are pointed straight, which affects the people at the front of the room sitting sort of underneath the speaker, they don't get as much of it as someone sitting in the back. As I mentioned, the room is treated, but the shape of the room is really hard to fight so there's only so much the treatment can do for us. So for now I'd like to solve the speaker issue and see if there's any better options available. For a 1200sq ft room, two 1300watt speakers are a bit much, I think, although I can't seem to find anything smaller than that that is also 3-way. 

So my first question/assumption is, changing the way my current Mackies are mounted, by aiming them a bit more down, would that help the distribution of sound?

My second question is, are there any speakers that may be better suited for the job? For a second I was thinking about doing a faux-vertical array with 4 speakers, 2 on each side, one pair pointing straight ahead and one pair pointing down more, but maybe there's a single pair of speakers that may do the trick without having to work on an array. I should mention my budget for this is ~$2000 (hopefully less).

Obviously changing the mounting on my current speakers would be the cheapest option, probably not running me any more than $1000 for the parts and labor, but speakers I've been looking at have been $1000+ each. 

Hope to hear some good suggestions, and thanks in advance.",t2_lh38z,1

MR18 vs X32R,"Hi All,
I've searched through almost all discussion on the MR18, X32R, and the closely related XR18 on this sub--but I still have some questions that hopefully you all can help me out with.

I am a hobbyist, and would be looking to only use this mixer for small ensembles (mostly 6-10 vocalists on handhelds) as well as for my primary interface for recording.  

It seems to me like most of the arguments for the X32R are that it is a more effective mixer at adapting to large scale gigs, and interfaces well with the other x32 products.

On the other hand, the MR18 is smaller, and has the midas preamps.  I haven't had the chance to play with either, but I'm under the impression that this would give the MR18 a better sound--is this true?

Are there any other major factors I should consider? Effect/app differences? The two are at a fairly close price point, so I'm just trying to get the most bang for my buck for my use case.

Help/Advice determining if Audio Equipment is ample for Venue.,"Hello.

I am currently organizing a concert event with a semi-notable rapper and am trying to gauge if the audio equipment that is being provided by the production company will be enough for the venue. First, I think it is important to note that the production for the event is being coordinated by the rapper's manager and is being rolled into the overall booking cost of the artist. This leads me to believe that they would be motivated to skimp on production costs and supply subpar equipment, as it would mean more money for them. I have no serious knowledge of audio equipment on this scale, so I am enlisting your help to make an educated decision.

**Venue Details:** We are expecting 1500-2000 people for this event. The performance will take place inside a 2,000 sq ft basement (concrete floor and walls). The basement opens up to a 1-acre outside area. 2 large windows and 2 double doors on the exterior wall will be removed to allow for sight and audibility of the performance to those outside. 

**Production Details (they are valuing at $2500) :**

* Behringer X32 (Quantity: 1)
* Behringer S16 (Quantity: 3)
* Shure ULX-D Wireless (Quantity: 3)
* EV ETX 15P (Mains) (Quantity: 6)
* EV ETX 18SP (Subs) (Quantity: 2)
* QSC HPR 122i DJ Monitor (Quantity: 1)
* Speaker Stand (Quantity: 6)
* Mic Stands (Quantity: 2)
* Audio Cable Kit (Quantity: 1)
* Audio Power Cable Kit (Quantity: 1)
* LABOR: Audio Engineer 1(Quantity: 1)
* LABOR: Stage Hands (Quantity: 2)

**Questions:**

1. Is a value of $2500 fair for this amount of equipment? If not, any suggestions for other production options? (Located in SC)
2. Will this amount of equipment provide ample sound performance, not only inside the basement but to the aprox. 1000 people in the outdoor area? If not, what do I need to ask for to get the performance I am looking for? (Power output is not a problem. We have more than enough.)
3. The absence of lighting equipment is something that is bothering me. If I were to ask for a standard/budget lighting setup for inside the basement, how much should I expect the price to increase?

Thoughts on Bose's RoomMatch arrays? Just wrapped our shiny new install,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/2t9B8Hp](https://imgur.com/gallery/2t9B8Hp)

I'm really impressed by this system, and I normally hate Bose Professional PAs. This lineup seems great though, because it's based on physical box design, and maximum number of box angle options, rather than digital steering mojo and time delay magic. Those seems to be bose's traditional marketing tools. But there's nothing magical about the design or function, just flexible designs made possible by the number of options for elements you can choose. We have an odd shaped room, with little floor space, and we were able to cover the entire room, including flying the 2x18 sub, from front row to back of the balcony with a single array, no delay fills, and minimal sound directed outside the seating area.

Reflections are much less pronounced, sound is clear and full, very even coverage thanks to the single hang, transition between boxes is smooth, and directional control seems very nicely implemented.

Problems of short blackouts on stage,"To preface, I am an electrician by trade and all I do is work in the sound room at church every other week. I did not set up the stage, wiring or otherwise, but I am able to troubleshoot and know who to ask to get answers if needed. 

The problem- during practice everything went smoothly. No blips. As soon as the congregation came in and the band started the sound AND projection cut out for 1-2 seconds and then everything went back to normal. No problems until the band started playing again after a short talk. This happened about 5 times today.

I'm told the power and AV are run very independantly so there shouldn't be any interference which is all I could think of. I'm sure there are many more intricacies that I am not aware of when it comes to AV. I'm not tasked with fixing the problem but I figured I would ask yall if there were any ideas for what could be going wrong. Thanks in advance.",t2_6difv,1

Anyone know of a multi input mixer that is incredibly simple to use?,"So we have a fairly simple little powered mixer that is in the youth area at our church.  You would think that this would be something people could handle. However, every time I use it, the inputs are all out of whack, inputs clipping, eq turned all the way down, etc. 

Is there a mixer with 4-8 channels that has a digital interface with no knobs or hidden knobs so the settings could be locked?  Also, something with auto gain control might be nice for when they crank the computer output to 11. 

Right now this is accessible to a wide range of parent volunteers and high school students. Something with a simple volume control would be best. ",t2_5yv2rzt,1

Podcast monitoring,"I hope this is the right place for this...

I have several friends that want to get together on a freeform podcast project and record random crap for two hours or so.  As a proof of concept, we want to try a few of them and see how they are received.  We don't want to invest thousands into a bunch of high-end audio gear (that none of us know how to use) if we don't have to.  I would like some suggestions on how to pull this off given the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1- I plan on capturing a muti-track using Adobe Audition on my macbook pro with 3 to 5 people sitting around just shooting the crap.  I will route all audio through a thuderbolt USB hub.

2- We are going to start with entry level microphones, probably the Audio-Technica AT2005USB.  

3- One of the biggest issues is this: I don't know how to get everyone monitoring the multichannel mix.  I have done some pretty simple google searches, but I am having no luck with it at all.  

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I know that the majority of folks in here are pros and will curse this idea as amateur and not worthy of their time, I am just hoping that someone can give me some direction and advice to make a low budget audio engagement sound decent while allowing everyone to monitor the multichannel mix down in real time so that we are not all stepping on each other during the conversation.

AH QU32 vs m32,"This has been asked many times and may spiral into a flame war, I'm highly aware.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a newcomer to our HOW who has a past in brass and percussion performance, but not live mixing. The leadership of the HOW has asked him to select us a replacement for our Mackie ONYX 32.4 console. He's adamant that the QU32 is the best sounding board for under $5000. ***However***, our HOW has the soundboard in a separate room from mains (I wish I had power over this decision), and we'll be largely reliant on mobile apps and laptops from the audience to do most mixing.

&amp;#x200B;

From my searching, the m32 has fantastic support for Win,Mac,Linux,iOS,Android, while the QU32 only supports Apple devices. The newcomer is an Apple user and is ignoring the incumbents (including myself) who do not have supported devices.

Need to extend a sound snake,"So I do basically all of the audio here at a retreat center I work at. We are doing a remodel on one of our larger meeting spaces, and that includes moving the sound booth from the middle right side of the room to the far back in the middle. I need to figure out how to move all of the existing sound equipment back there. My biggest issue is the snake. It is a 24 channel snake that I believe the contractor we hired cut towards the end and put in some Ten 47 Tourline connectors (85 pin) on so the sound booth can be detached and moved from the wall if needed. This leads to 2 questions:

1. Is it a bad idea to buy a male and female set of connectors and use an old snake to make an extension between the gap
2. Does anyone know where i can buy the connectors at, as alot of the websites seem to be out of stock.

"QLab stuttering and dropping audio,","Hi gang,

Hopefully a question that is easily answered.

It doesn’t happen every time, and the tracks work fine when not played within the context of the full show. I’m guessing it’s either a QLab 3 or Mac Mini problem with processing. Any ideas would be loved.

I figure they won't be as pedantic as the rider suggests, most artists aren't. WRONG!


She's not happy with my ""slightly shorter than 29""  barstools. Wants to move everything even though I matched the rider stage plot perfectly. Etc. But then....

""When was the last time the system was tuned?"" (she hadn't heard it yet.)


""It was professionally tuned by a production company using our speaker processor, RTA mics and smaart software, after we installed about 60k worth of acoustic treatment 6 months ago.""

Subtractive EQ vs additive and subtractive EQ.,"I have a studio background, but currently work as an audio guy.

Because of my studio background, My coworkers keep giving me a hard time when I EQ. 

At some points I boost and cut at the same time, and it sounds good, especially when it’s A/B’d, but everyone keeps telling me I shouldn’t be boosting at all. Only cutting frequencies, but I’ve never heard that. 

I think my confusion comes from learning mostly in a studio environment, where it’s fine to boost frequencies, but now getting into live sound is where I run into people giving me a hard time about my EQ. If it sounds fine, why wouldn’t I boost frequencies? Can someone clear this up for me? ",t2_2jh28i2i,8

Looking for recommendations on a portable PA for an assortment of college events around campus!,"Good afternoon all, 

Looking to create a portable PA system for a campus tech team to supply all needs for a multitude of events. These events may include some worship nights with smaller bands, providing a microphone and music for events ranging from 100-500 people.
